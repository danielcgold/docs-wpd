{{Basic Page}}
There are a number of tasks to do as we progress WPD through to the alpha and beta stages (we could call them alpha 2 and beta 1, perhaps, as alpha has already passed). The trouble we are getting right now is that there is so much work to do, that we are getting overwhelmed and as a result not as much is being done as we'd like. To combat this, we are going to follow a priority list, focusing on each smaller task in turn until we get it done, then moving on to the next, to make the work seem more maneageable

=Beta — May 1st 2013=

==Make sure the session issues are fixed==

* Type: bug
* Owner: Doug
* Description: We have all experienced this — loss of session and therefore being logged out midway during a page edit.
* More Details: **fill in bug link**
* Priority justification: This is quite simply, the most destructive bug we have. It annoys almost everyone who uses the site, and is really damaging our reputation
* Duration: hard to say

==Dabblet integration==

* Type: feature addition
* Owner: Doug
* Description: Lea has added JavaScript support to Dabblet, and got it ready to be integrated with WPD
* More Details: **fill in bug link**
* Priority justification: We really would like to have live code examples running alongside our articles, and this is the mechanism to do it. This would be a huge plus to the site.
* Duration: hard to say

==Localisation framework==

* Type: feature addition
* Owner: Doug
* Description: framework for adding page translations to WPD, in a seamless and easy to handle way.
* More Details: **fill in bug link**
* Priority justification: A lot of people want to contribute to WPD not via new content, but by translations of existing content. We should give them a mechanism they can use to do this quickly, before they lose enthusiasm for the project.
* Duration: hard to say

==Add "WPD" inside article titles for better SEO==

* Type: feature addition
* Owner: Doug
* Description: programmatically add the string "WPD" to each main page heading
* More Details: **fill in bug link**
* Priority justification: We want to emulate the SEO success MDN has had with having "MDN" in all page titles. You can search MDN: x in a search engine to bring up the MDN page on subject x, and this is awesome.
* Duration: should be pretty quick

==Add site wide navigation menu==

* Type: feature addition
* Owner: Lea/Doug
* Description: Add a navigation menu to every PWD page that allows you to easily navigate between any articles on the site
* More Details: **fill in bug link**
* Priority justification: WPD currently has a lot of content, but it is quite hard to navigate through it. Adding a standard topic/category navigation menu to every page would make things much better in this regard
* Duration: hard to say

==CSS properties content task==

* Type: content
* Owner: Alex
* Description: Perfect all CSS property reference articles
* More Details: [[WPD:Tasks/CSS_Property_Milestone]]
* Priority justification: WPD has a lot of content that needs to be sorted, but CSS is higher priority. There are a relatively small number of CSS properties to handle, and we have a reasonably good base of articles already to build upon and sort out. CSs is also commonly sought after documentation. This all said, CSS properties are a good model island of documentation to start with, so we can then move on to others with confidence. And as a final plus, Alex has mentioned that the Google Chrome dev tools team are looking for a set of CSS articles to point to for the in-app documentation they are making available in their tool. If WPD CSS articles were available to use for this, it would be a huge plus
* Duration: three months

==API references==

* Type: content
* Owner: Scott
* Description: Perfect all API reference material
* More Details: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Proposals/api_docs
* Priority justification: APIs would be a good set of documentation to go on to next — they already have a plan, and passionate project leader (Scott)
* Duration: three months, to run at least in part concurrently with the CSS properties task

=Beta 2 — August 1st 2013=

==CSS: other reference articles==

* Type: content
* Owner: ???
* Description: Perfect all other CSS reference articles
* More Details: ???
* Priority justification: With the CSS property references out of the way, it would then make sense to sort out the other CSS references.
* Duration: one month

==CSS: tutorials==

* Type: content
* Owner: ???
* Description: Perfect all CSS tutorials and concept articles
* More Details: ???
* Priority justification: Now moving on to the CSS tutorials/concepts
* Duration: three months

==HTML references==

* Type: content
* Owner: ???
* Description: Perfect all HTML references
* More Details: ???
* Priority justification: HTML should be the next set of articles to move on to, as it is one of the central three most important web standards
* Duration: three months

==HTML tutorials==

* Type: content
* Owner: ???
* Description: Perfect all HTML tutorials and concept articles
* More Details: ???
* Priority justification: now moving on to HTML tutorials
* Duration: three months

* DOM reference pages
* Beginners guide

=For later=

* SVG
* General web concepts

=Level of content robustness we want to achieve (quality and quantity)=

* Stubs (at least) for all non-proprietary DOM methods/properties/objects, CSS properties (… more?)
* Complete, accurate compatibility tables on all CSS properties and DOM methods/properties on document, window, (… more?)
* 50 localized articles (which implies we have a reasonable localization framework)
