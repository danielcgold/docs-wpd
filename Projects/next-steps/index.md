Ideas we want to propose that are one of WebPlatform/W3C strengths or things we have in place.

We looked at doing documentation like MDN, and it wasn’t particularily successsful. Lots of efforts, can be a resource-blackhole, we can only have a limited success. We should maybe instead focus at things we would bring better value to developers. Not just "replacing" MDN.
