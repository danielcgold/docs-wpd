Ideas we want to propose that are one of WebPlatform/W3C strengths or things we have in place.

We looked at doing documentation like MDN, and it wasn’t particularily successsful. Lots of efforts, can be a resource-blackhole, we can only have a limited success. We should maybe instead focus at things we would bring better value to developers. Not just "replacing" MDN. 

The unique of WebPlatform can offer is the W3C’s association and standards. For both audience, web developers and related to standards (maintenance and new specification). How can we best serve the audience.

What we learned while running WPD in the last years:
* Very little overlap between communities: standards, and web developers (success indicator)
* We didn’t have much attraction of web developer as an audience (new audience, a success)
* Bad thing is that we didn’t get much attraction from the standards community
* Our content might need to do more curation, lets set priorities and  focus on them
** Features that arent’ really well documented (e.g. SVG)
** '''Emerging technologies''', recently spec'ed, and not much documentation about them
** Increase involvement from the standards people. Help them participate with us.
