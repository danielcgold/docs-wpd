We will submit a talk proposal to both SXSW Edu, and SXSWi. The target audiences are different, and this is reflected by the talk proposals. In general, our goals are to:

* promote WPD
* promote collaborative documentation
* ask people to help us
* tell the world what WPD is, and why we created it
* what problems does it aim to solve?

== SXSW Edu talk proposal==

'''Janet's comment: For SXSWedu, the goal would be to promote awareness and participation among educators, by emphasizing how the site can help them to teach and to create reusable teaching materials.'''

===Title===

webplatform.org: documenting web development (not the best title in the world, but you are limited to 50 characters)

===Presentation format===

Solo or Dual presentation. (there are lots of us, so doing it as a panel is tempting, but I think panels tend to suffer from fragmentation and loss of cohesive message. If we wanted to do a panel, we'd have to think very carefully about it.)

===Difficulty level ===

Intermediate (the ideas presented are not hard to grasp, but web platform.org is a pretty advanced kind of site to set up, so you could say the content is advanced)

===Tags ===

documentation, community building, web development (you are only allowed three)

===Category===

Standards and assessment (not great, but this seems to be the most appropriate of the options given)

===Intended audience===

Educators that teach web-related subjects, web developers and designers, students wishing to learn web-related subjects

===In 1000 characters or less, describe your panel idea to us===

The web industry is one of the fastest-growing industries; even in times of recession, everyone wants a web presence, because it is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to market yourself and find customers, friends, and more. But in spite of this, the web industry suffers from a shortage of new people with the skills required to do the job well. Very few web-related courses do a great job of teaching modern web design, so many people teach themselves. For self learners, finding reliable, good quality learning and reference material is difficult, as there is so much available out there.

To improve things, the W3C got together with a number of other companies — many of whom already have their own documentation and other resources — and decided to to produce the ultimate, definitive, community-powered documentation resource for web design and development. This resource is called webplatform.org, and hopes to succeed where others have failed.

===List three questions that this talk will answer===

# How such a large project is funded and created, in cooperation between several often competing companies.
# How the site was built, and surrounding technical issues.
# How a successful community can be used to create a lot of documentation, including handling contributions from already existing resources.
