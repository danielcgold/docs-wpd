=Projects=
The subpages here document the various larger-scale projects the community is working on. Both content and infrastructure projects are located here.  Very large-scale projects also have a project issue tracking page at [https://projects.webplatform.org|projects.webplatform.org].

Projects here start out as proposals. Anyone is welcome to submit a proposal. If you have a proposal for the WPD community to consider, your proposal may require example pages or other detailed description or illustration, which you can create in the subpages here. If you create a proposal subpage, get feedback by emailing the community at the '''public-webplatform@w3.org''' email list.
