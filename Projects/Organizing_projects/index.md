===Background===

Our new [http://project.webplatform.org|project.webplatform.org] space should help us achieve our mission. The activities around this mission should broken down into [[WPD:Project_Status|milestones]], with all projects and tasks directed toward that milestone, or deferred until the next milestone.

This document proposes an project architecture to reflect these requirements.

===One mission: One master project===

We will a top-level view of the mission's progress. Users of project.webplatform.org will be able to see a top-level status of the progress toward a milestone, and then drill down into functional areas to see the state of that area.
