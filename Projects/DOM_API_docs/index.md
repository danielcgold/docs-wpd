=DOM API documentation=

This is the project page for the DOM API documentation on WPD.

==Purpose==

The purpose of this documentation is to describe the Document Object Model for developers using JavaScript to build applications that work with DOM artifacts. It is not an architectural study of the DOM, nor is it intended to support the development of the DOM itself.

==Scope==

This documentation will cover the DOM artifacts relevant to their use in JavaScript. This document does not cover the HTML elements or CSS artifacts that otherwise are considered part of the DOM. Nor does this project deal with the SVG or MathML content in WPD.

==Tasks==

The two primary tasks of this project are as follows:
* Reorganize the DOM API documentation in a coherent structure that supports short, predictable URLs.
* Fill in the pages with information currently missing.

==Reorganization==

Consider the current state of the [[dom|DOM]] pages.
