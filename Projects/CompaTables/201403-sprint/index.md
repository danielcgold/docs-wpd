= Sprint of 2014-03 =

Sprint report, extending documentation at [[WPD:Projects/CompaTables]]

== Work done ==

'''mdn-compat-importer''':
* Process and normalize data (living implementation)

'''CompaTables MediaWiki Extension''':
* Implement mdn-compat-importer ''[[#Current normalized data]]'' (living implementation)
* Relies on Memcached to save/purge/re-use chunks of HTML
* Allow manage markup-free text arrays (e.g. in format=table, the word "Unsupported" be in a dd tag, while in format=list it can be in a abbr tag)
* Support alternate URL for table itself on its own view:
** [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Special:Compatables?feature=border-radius&format=table Table in a standard view]
** [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Special:Compatables?feature=border-radius&format=table&foresi=1 Table alone (used for ESI, see in URL '&foresi=1')]
* Purging Memcached version of generated HTML views:
** When origin JSON file date changes mismatch cached version
** Purging a particular table directly, along with ESI purging mechanism  [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Special:Compatables?feature=border-radius&format=table&action=purge see in URL note '&action=purge']
* Should not break current ESI support feature
* Rudimentary A11y markup (needs testing). Done according to [http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#identifying-table-rows-columns this WCAG1 checkpoint]


== To fix or improve ==

==== CompaTables MediaWiki Extension ====
* List view format (format=list) is not using latest ''[[#Current normalized data]]'' 
* Table view format 
** doesn't show prefix icons (e.g. -webkit)

==== ESI ====
To use ESI, work has to be done on the servers. To summarize the findings, we cannot enable ESI tags on Fastly as it is at the moment due to a set of factors:

Fastly's Varnish version (2.1.5) doesn't support gzip between backend and varnish; (but Varnish 3.x+ do.)
* Between our servers ("backend") and Fastly we use currently compress with gzip
* Fastly has plans to upgrade their varnish, but its out of our hands

To enable;
* Disable gzip between our backend servers and Fastly (might increase the data transfer usage, to validate with fastly)
* Enable gzip only from Fastly to our visitors (currently gzip is in both places)
