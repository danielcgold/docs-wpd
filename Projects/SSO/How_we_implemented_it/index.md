= How we implemented SSO =

== Summary ==

The objective of this document is to describe how we implemented a SSO solution for WebPlatform.org. It is meant to give a high level overview of the various moving parts parts.

The authentication portal is using our own fork of Mozilla Firefox Accounts ("FxA") deployed on WebPlatform.org infrastructure. Details of the adaptations are described in [[WPD:Projects/SSO/Adapt_Firefox_Accounts_for_WebPlatform]].


== Using OAuth2 to start a session ==

=== Stories ===

* As a non authenticated person, I want to edit in the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/border a page on docs.webplatform.org/wiki/] ("A"). 
* As a non authenticated person, I want to add annotations on both [http://www.w3.org/2014/annotation/experiment/webaudio.html W3C specs] ("B") 
* As a non authenticated person, I want to experiment with Docs features in the [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/css/properties/border "test" wiki at docs.webplatform.org/test/] ("C"). 
* As a non authenticated person, I want to be allowed to edit [http://docs.mroftalpbew.org/wiki/Main_Page Staging wiki] and see if the upcoming deployment will work ("D")
* As a non authenticated visitor, I want to start a session and be allowed to perform [A, B, C, D] without authenticating myself more than once


=== 0. Premise ===

In order to fulfill the given stories, we needed to implement a SSO solution that allows multiple web applications to talk together, provide a single authority resource to provide user details, and let each configured web applications to handle their local users and sessions.

In this implementation we are passing through authentication to get an OAuth2 Bearer token so that we can get data on the behalf of the authenticated user. 

The following makes use of the generated Authorization token to read a profile server and read associated user data (i.e. email address, full name, username, etc.) that will be used in all web applications.

''NOTE'' At the moment, the Authorization token is used only once. In future development, we might want to add features and will need to store securely that token to make other actions on the behalf of the user.


=== 1. Configure the OAuth server to accept requests from a client ===

In OAuth terminology, a client is a consumer that is authorized to rely on the OAuth server. A client can be a web application, but its not only limited to that.

In this example, we are allowing [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/ WebPlatform Docs test wiki] to use the accounts server to authenticate users.

Client configuration is described in the project documentation available in the  [https://github.com/webplatform/fxa-oauth-server/blob/master/docs/clients.md WebPlatform's fork of FxA OAuth Server in ''docs/clients.md''].

An client entry looks like this:

<syntaxHighlight>
  "clients": [
    {
       "id": "7e7e11299d95d789",
       "secret": "a331e8a8f3e553a430d7e5b904c6132b2722633af9f03128029201d24a97f2aa",
       "name": "WebPlatform Test",
       "image_uri": "...",
       "redirectUri":"http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Special:AccountsHandler/callback",
       "whitelisted": true
    }
  ]
</syntaxHighlight>

* <tt>id</tt>: Is a 8 byte hexadecimal string that you will need to have on the client configuration
* <tt>secret</tt>: Is a 32 byte hexadecimal string that you will also need on the client configuration.
* <tt>redirectUri</tt>: Is where you should send the users to when they successfully authenticated. 

To continue with our example, we are connecting to a MediaWiki installation that has the [[WPD:Projects/SSO/MediaWikiExtension WebPlatformAuth Extension]] available. In the case of that particular extension, it expects that we send authenticated users back to '''Special::AccountsHandler/callback'''.


=== 2. Configure client ===

Configuring a client to use our OAuth server can be different depending on how the extension implements OAuth2. 

Regardless of the exact configuration lines or code, every OAuth2 clients has similar configuration lines.

Such as:
* Start the process
* Generate an Authorization token

In the case of our implementation, we also added (<tt>fxa_profile</tt>) so that we can read user data from somewhere.

Our MediaWiki extension has similar configuration in its <tt>Settings.php</tt> file:

<syntaxHighlight>
require_once( "$IP/extensions/WebPlatformAuth/WebPlatformAuth.php" );
$wgWebPlatformAuth['client']['id']             = '7e7e11299d95d789';
$wgWebPlatformAuth['client']['secret']         = 'a331e8a8f3e553a430d7e5b904c6132b2722633af9f03128029201d24a97f2aa';
$wgWebPlatformAuth['endpoints']['fxa_oauth']   = 'https://oauth.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/';
$wgWebPlatformAuth['endpoints']['fxa_profile'] = 'https://profile.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/';
$wgWebPlatformAuth['methods']['authorize']     = 'authorization';
$wgWebPlatformAuth['methods']['token']         = 'token';
</syntaxHighlight>

While configuration can be different depending on the client extension, a few endpoints are required to be used in our installation.

* <tt>GET https://oauth.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/authorization</tt>
* <tt>POST https://oauth.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/authorization</tt>
* <tt>POST https://oauth.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/token</tt>
* <tt>GET https://profile.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/session/read</tt>, with scope 'session'

Most of these requests arenâ€™t made through the browser but through a server-side HTTP client. In the MediaWiki extension, we are using Guzzle. 

''NOTE'' Even though the calls are aimed at endpoints under SSL, it feels safer to have those requests made outside of the reach of the visitor web browser.


=== 1. From a page, when you click login ===

==== 1.1. Possibility: No previous session detected ====

The MediaWiki extension detects the click and sends you to '''Special:AccountsHandler/start'''. Its an internal process to generate a redirect to the OAuth2 authentication flow.

The web application generates and sends user to the OAuth authentication endpoint, with some data:
* The client identifier ("<tt>client_id</tt>")
* What the application wants ("<tt>scope</tt>")
* What state it was in ("state"), this is a random key used to store inside a keystore such as memcache so we can retrieve the state data after the authentication process.

'''NOTE''' In Mozilla Firefox Accounts, the <tt>callbackUri</tt> is configured in the server configuration directly. This is considered safer to trust only the configuration file in contrast to common OAuth2 server implementation where they also want the <tt>callbackUri</tt> as part of the first redirect. This is a way to address a security breach in original OAuth2 specification.

Since the OAuth server knows who is the client, it adjusts the title to "Sign in to WebPlatform Test".

[[File:sso_steps_login_dialog.png]]

'''NOTE''' In the screenshot above, you see ''scope=profile''. Since that snapshot, we changed the scope name to  ''session'' because we needed to differentiate web application that will use OAuth to create local sessions from future use cases.

Once the authentication worked the accounts server sends you to the <tt>callbackUri</tt>(<tt>Special:AccountsHandler/callback</tt>). 

==== 1.2. Possibility: Detected a session ====

TODO


=== 2. Redirected the callback URI ===

From that callback, we get two keys:

* <tt>state</tt>: Is that string we gave in the previous step, we get it back so we can resume where we were before the authentication process. If the state data (e.g. previous page visited) was serialized and sent to Memcache, we can ask it once again and resume.
* <tt>code</tt>: This is a one-time token that we can use to get an OAuth2 Token. In this example, its "SOMETHING_LONG"

The callback URI looks like this:
    <nowiki>http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Special:AccountsHandler/callbackcode=SOMETHING_LONG&state=5a72cd23b1b5feb8</nowiki>

Based on the received data, we can continue with the OAuth2 handshake.


=== 3. Get an Authorization token ===

From the <tt>callbackUri</tt> handler, with the expected data (<tt>state</tt>, <tt>code</tt>) we make a few HTTP calls server to server (i.e. invisible to the web browser).

The call to get the Authorization token contains:

* <tt>client_id</tt>: The identifier we configured in both OAuth server and the client
* <tt>client secret</tt>: The shared secret
* <tt>code</tt>: The one-time code we got when redirected to the <tt>callbackUri</tt>.

The request is similar to this cURL call:

<syntaxHighlight>
curl -XPOST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    'https://oauth.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/token' \
    -d '{"client_id":"7e7e11299d95d789", 
         "client_secret":"a331e8a8f3e553a430d7e5b904c6132b2722633af9f03128029201d24a97f2aa", 
         "code":"SOMETHING_LONG"}'
</syntaxHighlight>

We get in exchange the Authorization token in a response that looks like this:

<syntaxHighlight>
  {"access_token":"6243bbcf3f1f451cc5b3f47e662568b90863995a4e675a3073eb72434ab2ba31",
   "token_type":"bearer",
   "scope":"session"}
</syntaxHighlight>

The <tt>access_token</tt> is what we needed to act on the behalf of the logged in user. 

At the time, the only protected service is the profile server, but we might want to protect other components later down the road.

'''NOTE''' An OAuth Authorization token is basically a key to make actions on the behalf of a valid user. In this regard, it is of the utmost importance to have it sent only through SSL, and, ideally, always outside of the reach of the web browser.


=== 4. Reading from the profile server ===

Assuming our web application has a valid Authorization token, we can get the account data we need from the profile server. 

Each requests made to an OAuth2 protected API such as the profile server has to be made accompanied with the Authorization token in the HTTP request header.

The call looks like this using cURL:

<syntaxHighlight>
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer 6243bbcf3f1f451cc5b3f47e662568b90863995a4e675a3073eb72434ab2ba31" \
     'https://profile.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/session/read'
</syntaxHighlight>

If the profile server accepted our Authorization token, we should get a JSON object looking like this:

<syntaxHighlight>
  {"username": "jdoe", 
   "fullName": "John Doe", 
   "email": "hi@example.org",
   "uid": "3E09D6DF843341BC929A25423AB83BAF" }
</syntaxHighlight>

We can now start the session in the client web application.

'''NOTE''' Authorization headers is functionally the same as what the web browser does with cookies. In fact, during a browsing session that has cookies, they are sent along with every HTTP requests. And that is, regardless of whether its an image, a CSS file, or a web page. The cookie is therefore a way to tell the application server to tell who the visitor is and potentially change the returned resource.


=== 5. Initialize local web application session ===

One of the key behavior in a SSO system is that each configured application relies on an authority to provide common user data (e.g. email, username, fullName), but also to confirm if it can start a session locally and overriding its own user validation system.

The profile server fills the purpose of providing that user data, and the Accounts server to confirm that the request is legitimate.
Since each web application can have different database, we are using this information to find if a user already exists in the local database, or we create one with the default details for the user. 

Based on the data received from the profile server, we initialize a session locally.

* Check if it can find a user matching the given username
* Create a new user if not
* Start local session, cookies, etc.

Also, from the state key we had earlier, we can resume where we were by retrieving what was stored originally in Memcache.

In the case of MediaWiki, we currently store the previous page the user visited and would look like this:

    {"return_to":"http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Projects/SSO/Login_Workflows"}

Based on that information, we issue a redirect and the user is back where he was.


== SSO and remembering ==

As described in [[#Stories]], the following describes how we can get the same data from [[#Using OAuth2 to start a session]], but without asking for the user to authenticate again.

To illustrate, we are going to show what happens when we:

* Authenticate from a [http://www.w3.org/2014/annotation/experiment/webaudio.html W3C spec] ("B") 
* Want to use experiment with Docs features in the [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/css/properties/border "test" wiki at docs.webplatform.org/test/] ("C").

Which, both, are the first using our new Accounts system.

To have the system to not ask the user to authenticate again we needed to find a way to check if a session is opened, and get the user data so I can create a local session from that trusted source.


=== SSO and remembering, proposal 1 ===

While the original design of Firefox Accounts OAuth server was to remember if a user previously authenticated, that functionality is not implemented yet. The issue is known and documented [https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/issues/1195 in their GitHub issue #1195].


=== SSO and remembering, proposal 2 ===

While this implementation proposal is some sort of workaround, it is designed to provide the same data we would get if the issue [[#SSO and remembering, proposal 1]] was implemented in the first place. But instead, we are going to use an iframe and some JavaScript. 

This process also covers appropriate Content Security Policy settings and how to retrieve the sessionToken and should not involve any popup.

'''Story''': A user clicks on login on an SSO enabled webapp. Once the OAuth handshake finished, the session is opened on the accounts.webplatform.org server.

The workflow in this code proposal should be run before [[#1. From a page, when you click login]]

==== FxA needs the following code ====

===== 0.1. In fxa-content-server, add =====

<syntaxHighlight>
      // WebPlatform Specific ===============================
      // file: app/scripts/views/base.js
      // line: 40
      // See: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Projects/SSO/How_we_implemented_it#SSO_and_remembering.2C_proposal_2
      var fxaC = this.fxaClient;
      function readAndReplyHasSession( e ) {
        var b = window.localStorage.getItem('__fxa_session');
        var sessionData = JSON.parse(b);

        fxaC.isSignedIn(sessionData.sessionToken)
            .done(
              function( promised ){
                e.source.postMessage({hasSession: promised, sessionToken: sessionData.sessionToken || null}, e.origin);
              }
            );
      }
      window.addEventListener("message", readAndReplyHasSession, false);
      // /WebPlatform Specific ==============================
</syntaxHighlight>

===== 0.2. And adjust the CSP policies =====

(Not ready yet)

<syntaxHighlight>
  // WebPlatform Specific ===============================
  // File: server/bin/fxa-content-server.js
  // Line: 62
  // Adjust helmet to accept xss from specific hosts
  // see: https://github.com/evilpacket/helmet
  // Comment, this:
  //app.use(helmet.xframe('deny'));
  // Instead:
  app.use(helmet.xframe('allow-from', 'http://webplatform.org'));
  app.use(helmet.csp({"script-src":["'self'", "*.webplatform.org", "*.mroftalpbew.org", "*.fastly.com"]}));
  // /WebPlatform Specific ==============================
</syntaxHighlight>

==== 1. Sign in to ("A") ====

In our case, letâ€™s connect through the [http://docs.mroftalpbew.org/wiki/Main_Page Staging wiki] ("A")

Complete signin in process through the accounts server ("C"), and you should get back to the staging wiki with a session opened.


==== 2. Go to ("B"), another web app that also uses the accounts server ====

In this example, letâ€™s use the test ("B") wiki http://docs.webplatform.org/test/Main_Page

The following JavaScript MUST happen.

===== 2.1. From B, prepare to receive message from C popup =====

This is where we listen to what we get from the accounts server, validate if a session exists, and trigger the calls to the profile server with the received data. (TODO)

    window.addEventListener("message", function(returned){console.log(returned.data)}, false);

===== 2.2. From B, open a popup/iframe to ("C") =====

'''Variant 1: Popup window'''

    var popup = window.open('https://accounts.webplatform.org', 'authchecker', "menubar=yes,location=yes,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes");

'''NOTE''' Ideally, it should be an iframe but we need to adjust Content Security Policies (TODO).

'''Variant 2: iframe'''

Create the iframe

    $('body').append($('<iframe src="https://accounts.webplatform.org" id="authChecker" frameborder="0" height="0" width="0"></iframe>'));

For this to work, we have to make sure that the Content server sends appropriate CSP headers

  // See 0.2
  app.use(helmet.csp({"script-src":["'self'", "*.webplatform.org", "*.fastly.com"]}));


===== 2.3. From B, Send trigger to ask message to the C window =====

Since C already has event listener described in 0.1, we should be able to send the following trigger:

'''NOTE''' At the moment, we are sending a post message with random data, we might change the trigger mechanism later.

'''Variant 1: Popup window'''

    popup.postMessage("hi", "https://accounts.webplatform.org");

'''Variant 2: iframe'''

    $('#authChecker')[0].contentWindow.postMessage('hi', 'https://accounts.webplatform.org');



==== 3. From B, you should get back a response coming form C ====

Provided a session is already open, we should get something similar to:

    {hasSession: true, sessionToken: "e73f75c00115f45416b121e274fd77b60376ce4084267ed76ce3ec7c0a9f4f1f"}

If there is no session in the accounts server ("C"), we would get:

    {hasSession: false, sessionToken: null}

==== 4. With a sessionToken, we can read data from the profile server ====

An endpoint accepts requests only from a limited set of IP addresses (only internal to WebPlatform servers), with a sessionToken (TODO)

    GET https://profile.accounts.webplatform.org/v1/session/recover?sessionToken=e73f75c00115f45416b121e274fd77b60376ce4084267ed76ce3ec7c0a9f4f1f

The profile server endpoint at <tt>session/recover</tt> makes database queries similar to:

    SELECT HEX(s.uid) AS uid, a.normalizedEmail AS email, a.username AS username, a.fullName AS fullName FROM sessionTokens AS s, accounts AS a WHERE s.uid = a.uid AND tokenData = unhex('e73f75c00115f45416b121e274fd77b60376ce4084267ed76ce3ec7c0a9f4f1f');

The database should either return an empty result, or user data:

    +----------------------------------+----------------+----------+--------------+
    | uid                              | email          | username | fullName     |
    +----------------------------------+----------------+----------+--------------+
    | 1F13A5DF833343AB937A25621AC85ECF | hi@example.org | jdoe     | John Doe     |
    +----------------------------------+----------------+----------+--------------+

==== 5. Returning the data to the server ====

If the web application could get a response from <tt>session/recover</tt>, and finds a result, it returns a JSON object similar to:

    {username: 'jdoe', fullName: 'John Doe', email: 'hi@example.org'}

In the case of an invalid/expired sessionToken, nothing/an error should be returned. TODO
