<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="HTML_elements_.26_attributes">HTML elements &amp; attributes</span></h1>
<p>Presently, there is no structured, semantic way to associate an HTML element element with the attributes that define that element, such as the <b>Applies to</b> form interface provided for API documentation, where members (events, methods, and properties) are associated with the object via the <b>Applies to</b> field. For example, the <a href="/wiki/html/elements/a" title="html/elements/a">anchor</a> element page has no information about the attributes that apply to it. Furthermore, the HTML elements have no mechanism that associates them with the events and methods that pertain to them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tasks">Tasks</span></h2>
<ul><li> Developing a cross-referencing system that associates each of the some 200 HTML attributes with any of the 155 elements to which it belongs.</li>
<li> Providing the DOM APIs with an <b>Applies to</b> field for the HTML elements upon which they operate.</li>
<li> Manually populating the fields for all artifacts.</li></ul>
