## <span>Accessibility</span>

Initial draft of structure for all accessiblity-related topics â€“ what is presented in which form, how it is structured, what is appropriate content and what not etc.

Meant to complete <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts/accessibility> while taking <https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20208> into account.
