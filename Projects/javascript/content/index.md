## JavaScript post-import content plan

Here's a proposal for how we'll run the JavaScript content plan

### Dependencies

To start the JavaScript content review, we'll need to have:

-   Donated content imported as described in the [JavaScript project plan](/WPD:Projects/javascript).
-   A template for the JavaScript language reference pages
-   Editing environment needs to be stable (no 500s & 503s)

## Community launch

Once we have the pages in place, we'll let the community know it's time to start editing.

### Announcement

We will blog about it, then following the channels of communication as follows:

|Channel|Owner|Order of release|
|:------|:----|:---------------|
|Blog post|Julee|1|
|Twitter|Doug|2|
|Google+|Alex|2|
|Facebook?| ???|2|
|Steward blogs|steward rep|3|

### Recruiting experts

Recruit 3-6 JavaScript experts, geographically dispersed, to advice editors throughout the project, attend Doc Sprints, and provide technical reviews.

## Completing editing & samples work

Completing editing & samples work depends on weekly contributions, as well as focused events such as Doc Sprints and tailored groups, such as students.

### WPW

We will continue Web Platform Wednesdays to parse out work, announce a bundle, and recruit contributors.

### Doc Sprints

Doc Sprints every month or two can get a lot of work through the pipeline.

### Schools

### Coordinators

Please sign up. The amount of contributions is directly proportional to the number of coordinators.

Available coordinators:

-   Julee

### Office hours

Please sign up. Editorial office hours are a way for us to let contributors know when we can focus on helping them.

## Review cycles

Once a first pass on the basic tasks & samples are complete, we'll have a review cycle to make sure editorial tasks are complete, samples are good and follow best practices. Then, we'll let the experts & influencers voice their opinion about the quality of the content.

## Launch

After completing editing, samples, and reviews, we'll be ready to announce the completion of this project. A launch plan should be drafted that considers timing and availability.
