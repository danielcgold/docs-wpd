==JavaScript post-import content plan==
Here's a proposal for how we'll run the JavaScript content plan
===Dependencies===
To start the JavaScript content review, we'll need to have:

* Donated content imported
* A template for the JavaScript language reference pages
==Community launch==
Once we have the pages in place, we'll let the community know it's time to start editing.
===Announcement===
We will blog about it, then following the channels of communication as follows:

{| class="wikitable sortable"

===Recruiting experts===

Recruit 3-6 JavaScript experts, geographically dispersed, to advice editors, attend Doc Sprints, and provide technical reviews.
