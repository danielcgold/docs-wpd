<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="JavaScript_post-import_content_plan">JavaScript post-import content plan</span></h2>
<p>Here's a proposal for how we'll run the JavaScript content plan
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dependencies">Dependencies</span></h3>
<p>To start the JavaScript content review, we'll need to have:
</p>
<ul><li> Donated content imported as described in the <a href="/wiki/WPD:Projects/javascript" title="WPD:Projects/javascript">JavaScript project plan</a>.</li>
<li> A template for the JavaScript language reference pages</li>
<li> Editing environment needs to be stable (no 500s &amp; 503s)</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Community_launch">Community launch</span></h2>
<p>Once we have the pages in place, we'll let the community know it's time to start editing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Announcement">Announcement</span></h3>
<p>We will blog about it, then following the channels of communication as follows:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recruiting_experts">Recruiting experts</span></h3>
<p>Recruit 3-6 JavaScript experts, geographically dispersed, to advice editors throughout the project, attend Doc Sprints, and provide technical reviews.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Completing_editing_.26_samples_work">Completing editing &amp; samples work</span></h2>
<p>Completing editing &amp; samples work depends on weekly contributions, as well as focused events such as Doc Sprints and tailored groups, such as students.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="WPW">WPW</span></h3>
<p>We will continue Web Platform Wednesdays to parse out work, announce a bundle, and recruit contributors.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Doc_Sprints">Doc Sprints</span></h3>
<p>Doc Sprints every month or two can get a lot of work through the pipeline.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Schools">Schools</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coordinators">Coordinators</span></h3>
<p>Please sign up. The amount of contributions is directly proportional to the number of coordinators.
</p><p>Available coordinators:
</p>
<ul><li> Julee</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Office_hours">Office hours</span></h3>
<p>Please sign up. Editorial office hours are a way for us to let contributors know when we can focus on helping them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Review_cycles">Review cycles</span></h2>
<p>Once a first pass on the basic tasks &amp; samples are complete, we'll have a review cycle to make sure editorial tasks are complete, samples are good and follow best practices. Then, we'll let the experts &amp; influencers voice their opinion about the quality of the content.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Launch">Launch</span></h2>
<p>After completing editing, samples, and reviews, we'll be ready to announce the completion of this project. A launch plan should be drafted that considers timing and availability.
