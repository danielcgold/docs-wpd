===What does it mean for the site to be in alpha?===
Web Platform Docs is in an "alpha" state because although it has a substantial amount of starter content donated by some of the stewards, it is still in a rough and incomplete state. We wanted to open it up to the larger community as early as possible so they can help shape the content and set the direction for the site. Over time, and with the help of the broader community, the goal is for the site to become the canonical source of documentation for web developers.

===Is this a content aggregation site?===
No, we started the site with existing content from the Stewards' documentation sites, but we already have fresh original content that will be added over the first few weeks, along with original content from the community.

===Who writes the content on the site?===
Web Platform Docs is a collaborative wiki, in the same vein as Wikipedia. Anyone is allowed to edit it and improve it. If you're interested in helping out, see the [[WPD:Getting_Started|getting started guide]].

===Do you plan to have information in multiple languages on the site?===
Yes. We expect active local communities to drive translations and localization of the siteâ€™s content.

===How do the stewards relate to the site?===
The role of the Stewards Committee is to ensure the long-term operations of the project. In practice, this means that the Stewardship Committee is focused on funding, infrastructure, branding, and site features, as well as other related matters that may arise that the community is not able to address. The Stewardship Committee explicitly does not play a role in managing the content of the center, nor in defining the processes the community adopts to manage itself, unless requested to by the community. The role of the Stewardship Committee is intentionally limited in favor of self-governance by the community. Although some representatives of the stewards participate in developing the site, they do so as peers of other members of the community.

===Who provides the funds to run the site?===
The Stewardship Committee provided funds to create, launch, and maintain the site. Any organization or individual may join the Stewardship Committee. W3C plays the role of administrator of the funds to ensure the site is available.

===What technology is the site implemented on?===
Web Platform Docs uses MediaWiki (which also powers Wikipedia) to run. It uses the Semantic MediaWiki and Semantic Forms extensions to apply more structure to the content and make it easier to edit.

===What's the difference between Web Platform Docs and WebPlatform.org?===
Web Platform Docs is a sub-component of the larger webplatform.org site, and is focused specifically on high-quality documentation for the Open Web Platform. Over time webplatform.org will grow to encompass additional functionality.
