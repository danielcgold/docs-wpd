==Sub-topic Clusters in WPD==

We have [[WPD:Implementation_Patterns/Templates#Topics.2C_Topic_Clusters.2C_See_Also|topic clusters]], which were designed to automatically generate a section of related pages in the See Also section. The list of topic clusters in [[Property:Topic_Cluster]] is a single-level list that could conceivably grow out of control, given the sheer volume of the content in WPD.

===Problems===

Too many pages being assigned to the same cluster resulting in overly-long lists of links. 

There seems to be a difference of opinion about what topic clusters are used for.
