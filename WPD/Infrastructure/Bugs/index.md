## <span>Summary</span>

How to report a bug or an issue to participate

## <span>Introduction</span>

Webplatform.org uses the [Its own project management system](http://project.webplatform.org/), using the open-source [The Bug Genie](http://www.thebuggenie.com/) software. We use this tool for bugs about infrastructure problems, administrative issues, and the like. Problems about the content and that are found in the topics within the WPD content library should be flagged in the topic and fixed by and within the community.

## <span>Creating an issue</span>

To create a new issue, just click *Report an issue* on one of the Project pages (e.g. [Content project](http://project.webplatform.org/content)).

## <span>Listing issues</span>

Each project has their own issue lists. If, for example, you want to follow and resolve any content related issues. You can keep a bookmark to [Content dashboard on the *Project* tracker](http://project.webplatform.org/content), and maybe [bookmark the *opened issues* list](http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/open) too.

## <span>Commenting on an issue</span>

Once an issue is open, you can add a comment in the Comment field and then click *Save changes*. You can comment in general on the bug or reply to a specific comment already in the issue history.

## <span>Resolving issues</span>

To resolve a bug, merely change the status to *RESOLVED*. A new dropdown menu appears listing choices for how the bug was resolved. After making the selection and adding any appropriate comments, save changes.

## <span>Access and permissions</span>

The [WPD Project manager](http://project.webplatform.org/) is accessible to anybody who wants to create an account on the system.
