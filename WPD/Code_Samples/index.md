## Code References

Code samples should be stored as a separate file from the article where they are referenced. Specific exerpts can then be referenced by multiple articles, with appropriate line numbering and specific lines highlighted. Code stored in this way can be run as an executable. Corrections or changes to the code made in one place will reflect everywhere the code is used, which is god for maintainablity; however, each such change should be followed by an analysis of referencing articles to make sure that the proper lines are still called and the explanation is still relevant; some sort of inline-diff tool, looking at particular versions of the code, would help with this review.
