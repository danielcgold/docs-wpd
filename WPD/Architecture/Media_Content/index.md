## <span>Accessibility</span>

-   videos and audio can be included in site, but requires captions
-   captions can be provided by poster or crowdsourced
-   any video or audio assets will be tagged as "stubs"
    -   no incoming links, and demoted (or removed) search results until captions provided

## <span>Inspiration</span>

### <span>videolectures.net</span>

**Example:** <http://videolectures.net/w3cworkshop2011_andrae_interoperability/>

#### <span>Features</span>

-   great features!
-   video side-by-side with image of slides
-   timed index of slides, clicking link loads slide and jumps to that point in video
-   short description of video
-   "Turn out the lights" obscures other parts of page, highlights video and slides

##### <span>Missing</span>

-   needs captioning
-   URI should change with each index (e.g. as video plays, and when user clicks)
