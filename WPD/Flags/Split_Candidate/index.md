title: Split Candidate
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Split Candidate'

---
This flag is used to mark pages that have content that should be split into multiple articles. In practice this may because a single article has grown too large to suitably cover a single topic.

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.

## Work Items

If an article has this flag, first think what other article should be created. Then create that article and start splitting up the content.

## Editorial Block

If you check off this flag you should include a [Template:Editorial/Split\_Candidate](/Template:Editorial/Split_Candidate) template in the body.
