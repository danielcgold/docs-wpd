This flag is used to mark pages that do not yet have all appropriate flags. This includes things like Standardization Status on articles for which it is appropriate.

## <span>Manual of Style</span>

**TODO**: Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.

## <span>Work Items</span>

If an article has this flag, figure out which [flags](/WPD:Flags) it should have and apply them. Then you can remove this flag and get started working through those work items!

## <span>Editorial Block</span>

This flag does not have an associated Editorial template to use.
