This flag should be checked for articles that have some content that has factually incorrect information. You should also mark the specific content that is incomplete using the associated Editorial block. Note that there are more specific flags for incorrectness in some areas, like examples, compatibility tables, etc.

**TODO**: Links to the other related flags

## <span>Manual of Style</span>

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## <span>Work Items</span>

Once all sections have the factual errors corrected you may remove this flag.

## <span>Editorial Block</span>

Be sure to mark which content has errors using the associated editorial block: [Template:Editorial/Content\_Errors](/Template:Editorial/Content_Errors).

The editorial block should be as close to the incorrect content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the errors are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.

If *most* of the content is incorrect, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
