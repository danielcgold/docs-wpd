title: Copyright Issue
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Copyright Issue'

---
This flag is used to mark pages that may potentially run afoul of the Copyright policy, which is a serious problem.

For example, it could be applied if the article contains contents from an external source but does not have the [correct attribution](/WPD:External_Attribution) or license set.

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.

## Work Items

If an article has this flag, understand and investigate the issues. Only if all copyright issues are resolved may you remove this flag.

## Editorial Block

If you check off this flag you must include a [Template:Editorial/Copyright\_Issue](/Template:Editorial/Copyright_Issue) template in the body to give more details.
