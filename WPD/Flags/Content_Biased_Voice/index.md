title: Content Biased Voice
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Content Biased Voice'

---
This flag should be checked for articles that have a biased voice that represents a strong point of view. For example, articles that including marketing or spam included among legitimate content should include this flag. You should also mark the specific content that is in a biased voice using the associated Editorial block. If the *entire* page sound like a marketing page or spam, you should probably mark it as a [candidate for deletion](/WPD:Flags/Deletion_Candidate) instead. Pages that are overly focused on one browser vendor should get the [not vendor neutral](/WPD:Flags/Content_Not_Neutral) flag instead (although it's conceivable that an article would have both of these flags if the article is very vendor specific and also uses very biased language).

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## Work Items

Once the entirety of the article has a netural point of view that does not unfairly support any specific viewpoint or product this flag can be removed.

## Editorial Block

Be sure to mark which content has biased voice problems using the associated editorial block: [Template:Editorial/Content\_Biased\_Voice](/Template:Editorial/Content_Biased_Voice).

The editorial block should be as close to the biased content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the biased pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.

If *most* of the content is biased, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
