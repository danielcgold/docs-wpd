title: Examples Errors
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Examples Errors'

---
This flag should be checked for articles that have examples that have errorsâ€”that is, the example wouldn't work correctly. You *may* use the associated editorial block to describe the problem if you wish.

## <span>Manual of Style</span>

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## <span>Work Items</span>

Once all examples on the page work correctly you may remove this flag.

## <span>Editorial Block</span>

You may use the associated editorial block to provide additional context on what examples are necessary: [Template:Editorial/Examples\_Errors](/Template:Editorial/Examples_Errors).

The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
