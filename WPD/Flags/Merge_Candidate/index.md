title: Merge Candidate
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Merge Candidate'

---
This flag is used to mark pages that should be merged. Often this is because the content is substantially duplicated in another article, for example because similar content was imported to the site from multiple sources.

If there are two or more peers that should be merged, this flag should be set on *all* of them.

If there is one primary article and one or more articles that are clearly of lesser quality, this flag should be set only on the other articles.

## <span>Manual of Style</span>

**TODO**: Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.

## <span>Work Items</span>

If an article has this flag, anyone can start to work to merge the denoted articles. Once the content of all of the articles has been moved to a single article and location, you can delete the useless pages.

If you add this flag, **you do not need to wait for permission**; this flag is mainly used as an "FYI" to others that someone is working on merging them.

## <span>Editorial Block</span>

If you check off this flag you should include a [Template:Editorial/Merge\_Candidate](/Template:Editorial/Merge_Candidate) template in the body.
