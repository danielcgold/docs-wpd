An important feature of any Web reference or documentation site is an accurate indication of whether the feature described works interoperably across different browsers. This is a heuristic that readers can use to assess whether a given feature is suitable for their use, and thus whether the article about it is worth their investment in time to read.

For features that are not interoperably supported, the article should list workarounds.

Another heuristic to assess whether a feature is suitable to use is one or more examples (with link at the very top of the page), so the reader knows whether the article is worth reading.

Any indications of support should include mobile browsers, as well as desktop browsers and authoring tools.
