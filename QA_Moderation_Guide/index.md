<p>Quick guide to Moderation of the WP Q&amp;A section.
</p><p>Here you can find a quick guide on "How to moderate the Q&amp;A section". Moderating is fairly easy, but a few things need to be kept in mind.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Basics">Basics</span></h4>
<ul><li> Be polite. Users tend to behave the same way moderators and admins do. Rude moderators will attract rude users, etc. No matter how rude users get, always respond in a decent way. If a user really gets out of line a ban is in place, not a flame-war fueled by moderators.</li>
<li> Be helpful. If a user asks questions that don't belong in the Q&amp;A section let them know in a responsible way. You might even want to give them some pointers on where they should look before closing the thread. That way users might actually come back when they have a question that does belong in the Q&amp;A section.</li></ul>
