<p>This page provides a way to share information about work that is in progress, and who's working on what. 
</p><p>Use this page to share about activities for any of these reasons:
</p>
<ul><li> It takes significant time and effort.</li>
<li> It affects multiple areas.</li>
<li> You want help from others to work on it.</li></ul>
<p>When work is completed, change the status to 'Done', and leave it in the table. It can be deleted later when it becomes less relevant.
