This page provides a way to share information about work that is in progress, and who's working on what. 

Use this page to share about activities for any of these reasons:
* It takes significant time and effort.
* It may impact multiple areas.
* You want help from others to work on it.

When work is completed, change the status to DONE, and leave it in the table. It can be deleted later when it becomes less relevant.
