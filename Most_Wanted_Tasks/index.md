{{Basic Page}}
Here is just a quick list of specific things that could be done around the site.  They are organized by the time that they fit into from the [[WPD:Getting_Started | Getting Started Guide]].  If you see something you want to take up, just do it and then please be neat and remove it from the list once you are finished.

Thanks in advance for any tasks completed!  


====5 Minute Tasks====


====Half Hour Tasks====


====Half Day Tasks====

* Help close [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19500 bug 19500]

* Help close [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19373 bug 19373] -could be much faster if you are experienced in MediaWiki's syntax.  As in like a 5 minute task.

* Help close [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19314 bug 19314]

Note:  These tasks are under half day tasks, but individual edits would be *far* faster.  Don't think you need to take on everything.  Just one or two edits in these areas is much appreciated.

* Look for duplicate pages that are in the root page.

* Put every page into a category except for the main page.  See the [[Special:UncategorizedPages|Uncategorized Pages]] to see where this is needed.

* Fix [http://docs.webplatform.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LonelyPages&limit=500&offset=0 Lonely Pages].   These are typically the pages that need the most work at this time.

* Move capitalized page paths that aren't following the style guide, check [[:Category:CSS]] for this

* Expand Topics on almost every page, every page should have multiple topics


====Always going====

* Clean up pages that do not have needed templates
