{{Basic Page}}
Here is just a quick list of specific things that could be done around the site.  They are organized by the time that they fit into from the [[WPD:Getting_Started | Getting Started Guide]].  If you see something you want to take up, just do it and then please be neat and remove it from the list once you are finished.

Thanks in advance for any tasks completed!  Have a cookie!
