===Why did you use [http://www.question2answer.org/ Question2Answer] instead of partnering with StackExchange?===
We are only using open source software for this project.  Therefore, we couldn't use StackExchange, because it's not open source.

Question2Answer seems like it has a large community and frequent and recent updates -- a good sign of life.

StackOverflow, and the StackExchange network at large, have great communities.  We aren't trying to undermine that; we're just trying to provide our community with a way to ask questions and provide answers about the site and about general web development within this community.

===Why is my username Capitalized?===
The technology behind the single-sign-on system uses MediaWiki's user accounts for authentication.  This means that usernames are subject to MediaWiki's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(technical_restrictions) naming conventions].  Specifically, "titles cannot begin with a lower case letter".

===How do Points Work?===
Currently Points are just a score. They are only a matter of prestige and do not grant any additional privileges. You earn points by completing actions on the Q&A sites. Here are the point values for each action:
<ul>
<li>Posting a question: 20 points</li>
<li>Selecting an answer to your question: 30 points</li>
<li>Per up vote on question: 10 points (limit 10 up votes)</li>
<li>Per down vote on question: -10 points (limit 3 down votes)</li>
<li>Posting an answer: 40 points</li>
<li>Answer selected as best: 300 points</li>
<li>Per up vote on answer: 20 points (limit 20 up votes)</li>
<li>Per down vote on answer: -20 points (limit 5 down votes)</li>
<li>Up or down voting a question or answer: 10 points</li>
<li>Registered account: 100 points</li>
</ul>
