===Why is my username Capitalized?===
The technology behind the single-sign-on system uses MediaWiki's user accounts for authentication.  This means that usernames are subject to MediaWiki's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(technical_restrictions) naming conventions].  Specifically, "titles cannot begin with a lower case letter".

<li>Selecting an answer to your question: 30 points</li>
<li>Per up vote on question: 10 points (limit 10 up votes)</li>
<li>Per down vote on question: -10 points (limit 3 down votes)</li>
<li>Posting an answer: 40 points</li>
<li>Answer selected as best: 300 points</li>
