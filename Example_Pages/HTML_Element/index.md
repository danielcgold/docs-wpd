## Summary

`<p>` — the paragraph element — is used to mark up a single paragraph in a given body of content. Wrapping content in paragraph tags will generally cause that content all to be rendered in a single block, with a margin above and below.

## Usage Context

||
|Categories|Paragraphs are phrasing content according to HTML5's definitions. It is also known to be a block level elements, under the earlier HTML definitions.|
|Permitted contents|Text, or any inline or text-containing flow content, such as `<a>`, `<em>`, `<strong>` or `<q>`.|
|Tag Omission|None — the start and end tags are mandatory.|
|Permitted Parent Elements|Any element that can contain flow content, typically content sectioning elements such as `<article>`, `<div>` or `<blockquote>`|
|Permitted Child Elements|**Chris - I don't think this is needed, as well as the permitted content, which I have renamed slightly to "permitted contents"**|

### Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [<http://webplatform.org/docs/WPD:CSS_Example_Article> global attributes. Attribute particular to this element are as follows:

-   `align`
    :   The paragraph element `align` attribute can be given values of `left`, `right`, `center` or `justify`, to align the content inside the paragraph. But please note that this is a presentational attribute, now deprecated in HTML5.

*The best practice would be to align your text using the CSS `text-align` property instead.*

## Examples

    <code><p>This is one paragraph of content.

    <p>This is another paragraph of content. See how it appears below the last paragraph on a new line.

    <p>This is a paragraph of content inside a blockquote.</code>

**Chris - I don't think we need to show JS and CSS examples affecting simple HTML content. I think this just muddies the waters a bit, for people trying to learn these basic rudiments.**

## Best practices

-   As said above, you should not align content with the `<p>` element's `align` attribute. Use the CSS `text-align` property instead.
-   You should separate all paragraphs out by wrapping each of them in their own unique `<p>` element. Do not separate out paragraphs by other means, such as wrappign all your content in a `<pre>` element, or using multiple `<br >`tags.
-   To alter the position or spacing of your paragraphs, dop not use presentational HTML; use appropriate CSS such as `padding` and `margin`.

**Chris - I've delete a lot of the sections from here, as I thought they were a bit repetitious. I thought "Best practices" would help to encompass all the good examples of usage and other things not said in other sections.**
