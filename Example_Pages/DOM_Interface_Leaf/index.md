## Summary

Node.appendChild() adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. If the node already exists it is removed from current parent node, then added to new parent node.

## Syntax

    var child=element.appendChild(child);

### Parameters

-   `element` is the parent element.
-   `child` is the node to append underneath `parent`. Also returned.

### Return Value

Returns `child`, the element that was appended.

## Examples

[View live examples](/w/index.php?title=DOM/interfaces/examples/appendChild&action=edit&redlink=1)

``` html
//LANGUAGE-TAG: JavaScript
//Create a div and append it to the body.
var oDiv=document.createElement("DIV");
document.body.appendChild(oDiv);
```

## Usage

If `child` is a reference to an existing node in the document, `appendChild` moves it from its current position to the new position (i.e. there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node).

This also means that a node can't be in two points of the document simultaneously. So if the node already has a parent, it is first removed, then appended at the new position.

You can use **cloneNode** to make a copy of the node before appending it under the new parent. (Note that the copies made with **cloneNode** will not be automatically kept in sync.)

This method is not allowed to move nodes between different documents. If you want to **appendNode** from a different document (for example to display results from AJAX request) you must first use **importNode**.

**appendChild()** is one of the fundamental methods of web programming using the DOM. The **appendChild()** method inserts a new node into the DOM structure of a document, and is the second part of the one-two, create-and-append process so central to building web pages programmatically.

This method is accessible at run time. If elements are removed at run time, before the closing tag is parsed, areas of the document might not render.
