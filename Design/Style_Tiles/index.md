These are the style tiles I've put together after doing some visual design research.
Please note, these are not intended to be "full" mock-ups, but rather an initial visual sketches possible directions for the webplatform.org wiki.
There are certainly numerous important elements "missing" from these style tiles - for example secondary/page level navigation.

I'd like your feedback on which style tile is most inline with the brand image that we'd like to portray. 
Please note that all fonts used are free.
