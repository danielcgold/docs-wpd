These are the style tiles I've put together after doing some visual design research.
Please note, these are not intended to be "full" mock-ups, but rather an initial visual sketches possible directions for the webplatform.org wiki.

There are certainly numerous important elements "missing" from these style tiles - for example secondary/page level navigation.
I'd like your feedback on which style tile is most inline with the brand image that we'd like to portray.

All fonts used are free.

==Final Decision==
The final decision by the Stewards was for a version of [[#Style_1|Style 1]] with some elements of [[#Style_2|Style 2]].

==Style 1==
The breadcrumbs should look like this example.
