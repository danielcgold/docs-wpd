These are the style tiles I've put together after doing some visual design research. Please note, these are not intended to be "full" mock-ups, but rather an initial visual sketches possible directions for the webplatform.org wiki.

There are certainly numerous important elements "missing" from these style tiles - for example secondary/page level navigation. I'd like your feedback on which style tile is most inline with the brand image that we'd like to portray.

All fonts used are free.

## Final Decision

The final decision by the Stewards was for a version of [Style 1](#Style_1) with some elements of [Style 2](#Style_2).

## Style 1

The breadcrumbs should look like this example.
