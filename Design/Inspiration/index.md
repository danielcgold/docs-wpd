Here are some site features from various sites that might be good inspiration for our own site design.


==Adobe Web Platform Team Blog==

Nice body-text font, readable and friendly. [http://font.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] typeface with font-size of 16px and line-height of 24px.

==VoilaVie.fr==

This site has several nice features:

===Shrinking Header===
The header banner shrinks and retracts when the user scrolls down, changing the focus from the initial impression of site identity to an unobtrusive, utilitarian 

Full:

Scrolled:

===Animated Scrolling Gallery Thumbnails===
Each gallery thumbnail consists of a picture and a caption; when the item is scrolled over, the caption title turns red, and the picture scrolls up to reveal the caption description.

==BadassJS==

A nice use of dropshadow on the content area, trendy floating folded banner, and subtle grid background to add texture.

==HTML5Rocks==

===Search & Navigation===
Nice use of icons in full-width menu dropdown to indicate different technology categories. Also, nice layout and colors on menus.

Ability to filter list of articles by format, audience, technology or tags (would be nice to have other parameters, like date, author, etc.).

===Profile Page / Bio===
Map of location, profile picture, list of contributions. (Our site should have a profile page for each contributor, but might have a "collection page" for all contributors in a team or employed by a specific organization.)

==DocHub==

Excellent autocomplete live-filtering search box. Simple, clear, non-distracting design.
