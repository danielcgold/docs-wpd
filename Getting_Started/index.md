=Start contributing content=
Anyone can contribute to the WebPlatform.org wiki. '''First''', read the [[WPD:Contributors_Guide|Contributor's Guide]] to learn how to set up your account, find information about how we work, and get the details about editing content. Then, come back here and dig in!

This page provides lists of pages that need your help; these are broken out by task. Scroll down the page to find a task you would like to perform. In the table for each task, click the link to a page that needs the work. 

'''As you work, do the following:'''
# Check out the page you are working on so that other editors do not attempt to work on the same page.
#: Edit the page, check the box, '''Checked out (this article is currently being worked on)'''.
#: Save the page, in the Summary for the edit, enter "Checking out."
#: Then reopen it and resume working.
#: Do not forget to uncheck the box when you are done editing the page, and in the Summary, enter "Checking in."
# If you have any questions, [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_2_communicate_with_the_online_community| just ask the community on IRC or e-mail]].
#: 
# Refer to [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content| Step 5 of the Editor's Guide]] for information about editing pages.
#:
# As you finish a chunk of work, clear the checkbox for the work issue (i.e. uncheck "Needs Summary" after you fill in the summary).

The tasks are listed by degree of experience and knowledge required. As you move from the basic tasks to more advanced tasks, you will gain greater expertise -- both in using the wiki and in the subject matter. Choose from the following types of tasks:

=Basic tasks=

Tasks in this category require little technical or subject-matter knowledge, do not require a lot of time to complete, and yet are very important to maintaining the readability and integrity of the content.

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Edit for spelling & grammar
|Description=Pages with the [[Special:SearchByProperty/Content-20quality-20flag/Grammar-2FSpelling|Spelling & grammar flag ]] checked require attention to fix grammar and spelling mistakes. Misspelled words are underlined with dashed red lines in the editing interface. When fixing these, it is often helpful to refer to the artifact's specifications for specialized terms. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content|Update existing content]] for more information.
|Content_Quality_Flags=Grammar/Spelling
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Fix broken links
|Description=* '''Fix broken links and misspelled words''' <br/>Broken links are fairly easy to spot on the wiki, because they display in a [[albatross/my broken link example|bold red color]]. Fix broken links or check the [[Special:SearchByProperty/Content-20quality-20flag/Broken-20Links|Broken Links flag]] so someone else can find the page and fix them. Misspelled words are underlined with dashed red lines in the editing interface. Please fix any misspelled words you find.
* '''Add more useful links''' <br/>Feel free to add useful, relevant links to external resources to show more examples to illustrate a technique or technology.
|Content_Quality_Flags=Broken Links
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Improve titles
|Description=Some titles may not fully describe the article. The article may have been imported without a title or there are other reasons the title needs revisiting. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content#Ensure_articles_have_descriptive_article_titles|Titles]] for more information.
|High_Level_Issues=Undescriptive Title
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Set topic flags
|Description=Every page should have at least one topic flag, usually more. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_6_author_or_upload_new_content#Topics_and_topic_clusters|Topics and topic clusters]] so you're clear on how to use these.
|High_Level_Issues=Needs Topics

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Provide syntax highlighting
|Description=Apply the correct code syntax coloring to code blocks. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content#Use_the_appropriate_syntax_highlighting_when_displaying_code|Syntax highlighting]] for details. With HTML code examples, if the <code>&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;</code> tag is not applied, the code will look broken, so making sure the tag is appied is crucial to the example's readability.

}} 

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Fill in missing summaries
|Description=Every page should include a short summary that provides an overview of the article. Summaries are used in generated overview pages and descriptions in tables (like the tables in this guide). Writing a summary requires just writing a sentence or two in your own words. For source material, refer to the article itself or supporting material like specifications and external references. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content#Enter_helpful_article_summaries|Enter helpful article summaries]] for more information.

}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Provide missing flags
|Description=Edit the page and check the different '''High-level issues''' and '''Content flags''' at the top of an article. Flagging pages is critical to help other contributors find tasks to do. You can either start with pages already identified as needing flags, listed below, or simply start in the wiki somewhere, looking for pages that have issues but no flags. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_4_review_existing_content#How_to_add_a_flag|Adding flags]] in the Editor's Guide.

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Fill in compatibility tables
|Description='''Note:''' We anticipate automating the population of the compatibility tables in the near future, and '''we recommend against working on compatibility tables''' by hand. Instead, use your time to work on the other tasks on this page. This information is included for reference only.

Generally, the missing information in compatibility tables can be verified by comparing other online resources, such as [http://caniuse.com/ www.caniuse.com] or the [http://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html www.quirksmode.org site]. Identify the compatibility of a feature for each browser, and then enter the values in the form. See the [[WPD:Getting_Started/Compatibility|Compatibility page]] to learn more.

}}
&nbsp;

=Involved tasks=

Articles in the lists below have issues for which the resolution may require subject-matter expertise or technical knowledge (fluency in JavaScript, CSS, MediaWiki, etc.).

==CSS properties==

The CSS property pages are a special project we're working on. We've selected some significant CSS properties. We're reviewing the reference pages, adding examples, editing, and improving the quality. For more information, see the [[Meta:web_platform_wednesday|Web Platform Wednesday]].


{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Edit content for neutrality
|Description=WebPlatform.org aims to provide vendor-neutral documentation. If you find a section that describes a feature as if it only works in a certain browser, or a section of code that could work across all browsers, but won't because it only uses one or two browsers' vendor prefixes, please edit these pages. If you cannot fix the page yourself, check the '''Not Neutral''' box under High-level issues so someone else can find and edit it.
|Content_Quality_Flags=Not Neutral
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Fix content that is not semantic
|Description=WebPlatform uses Semantic Media Wiki and Semantic Forms to organize information in a structured way. Sometimes, however, the information is represented on a page in an unstructured field. Often it is as simple as moving content from one text box to another. However, it may be that the extant forms do not provide a way to represent the information semantically, in which case the resolution first requires a new form/template to be added to the wiki. For that case, you would leave the "Data Not Semantic" flag checked and [[WPD:Filing_Bugs|file a bug]] to request the new form/template.

For example, in the page for the [[apis/webrtc/MediaStreamTrack/readyState|MediaStreamTrack.readyState]] property, the return value describes three possible enum values with raw text. A SMW form would more properly identify the values as an enum with a table of name, numerator, and description information for each value.

This type of issue is difficult to spot, but it is pervasive throughout the wiki. Basically, any time you see structured information - like an enum - represented in an unstructured way, you should check the '''Data Not Semantic''' flag for the page where you find that information.

See also the [[WPD:Implementation_Patterns|Implementation Patterns page]] to learn more about how we use forms and templates to organize and present information.
|High_Level_Issues=Data Not Semantic
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

==Review content==
The great thing about a wiki is that it's always under review. However, when an article is marked with the '''Needs Review''' flag, the author has specifically requested help from the community in verifying the content. Reviewing an article requires a working knowledge of the subject, and often requires the testing of code samples. When you review an article, always check it against the most recent specifications. See [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_4_review_existing_content|Review existing content]] for reviewing guidelines.

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====API pages that need review===
|Description=The API pages listed here require a review by a community member familiar with their subject matter and capable of evaluating JavaScript code samples.
|Topics=API
|High_Level_Issues=Needs Review
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====CSS pages that need review===
|Description=The CSS pages listed here require a review by a community member familiar with CSS.
|Topics=CSS
|High_Level_Issues=Needs Review
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Merge duplicates
|Description=Where articles are marked as '''Merge Candidate''' the article may be a duplicate of another article, or two or more articles may be sufficiently similar in scope to be merged. If you find an article that you believe is a merge candidate, mark the flag and cite the duplicate page in the Editorial notes field.
|High_Level_Issues=Merge Candidate
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

==Develop code examples==

Say it with code. Examples are by far the most important type of content we can produce, and every reference article should have a code example that describes how to use the feature. Presently we're concentrating on CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so we've listed those types of articles which need examples foremost.

See [[WPD:Manual_Of_Style/Code_sample_best_practices|Code sample best practices]] for guidance.

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====CSS pages that need examples===
|Description=Develop examples for CSS pages. Our topic types don't specify CSS ''properties'' per se, so look for the "css/properties" namespace identifier in the link to the article when concentrating on CSS properties pages.
|Topics=CSS
|Content_Quality_Flags=Examples Needed
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====API pages that need examples===
|Description=The JavaScript API pages listed here need code examples.
|Topics=API
|Content_Quality_Flags=Examples Needed
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====Other articles needing examples===
|Description=Here are some more articles that need examples.
|Topics=DOM, DOMEvents, HTML, JavaScript, MathML, SVG
|Content_Quality_Flags=Examples Needed
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title====Fix examples not following best practices===
|Description=Some extant examples need work. See [[WPD:Manual_Of_Style/Code_sample_best_practices|Code sample best practices]] for guidance.
|Topics=API, CSS, DOM, MathML, SVG
|Content_Quality_Flags=Examples Best Practices
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}} 

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Complete documentation
|Description=Much of the reference information is incomplete. Usually the work here involves revisiting the specifications or other materials and filling in missing information. Refer to the most recent specifications for the feature as you fill in the pages.
|Topics=API, CSS, DOM, DOMEvents, HTML, JavaScript, MathML
|High_Level_Issues=Missing Relevant Sections
|Content_Quality_Flags=Incomplete
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Clean up unreviewed imports
|Description=Much of the content on WebPlatform.org was imported via an automated process and has not been touched. In many cases, the content of a page is not properly organized within the page templates and forms. The content may be out of date, and it may be duplicative.
|High_Level_Issues=Unreviewed Import
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

{{Configurable_Query
|Title=Fill out Stubs
|Description=A stub is merely a placeholder established with the hope that someone will come along and fill in the page. This is a step beyond filling in missing information (see above), and usually requires starting from scratch. Be sure to refer to the most recent specifications for the feature you're documenting.
|Topics=API, CSS, DOM, DOMEvents, HTML, JavaScript, MathML
|High_Level_Issues=Stub
|Checked_Out=No
|Limit=5
|Show_Summary=Yes
|Show_High_Level_Issues=No
|Show_Content_Quality_Flags=No
}}

==Other involved tasks==
Herein are some other ideas for contributing to the docs.

* '''Add screenshots or supporting information''' <br/>Many articles have broken screenshot links, or include notes that a screenshot is needed. See the steps to [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_7_prepare_and_upload_assets_for_articles| Prepare and upload screenshots]], or provide examples and supporting information to illustrate techniques.
* '''Split articles'''  <br/>Create pages that convey a single, specific concept by splitting up long pages that contain a wide variety of different content.
* '''Write new articles''' <br/>If you'd like to author new pages,  see the suggestion board to find topics to write. If you are not sure if your topic idea is needed, [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_2_communicate_with_the_online_community| send a message to the team]]. If your topic suggestion is approved and you do not have time to write the entire article, it is still worth creating a new page with the beginnings of a new article on it. (This is called a stub page). To get more information about creating new pages, see [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_6_author_or_upload_new_content| Step 6 of the Editor's Guide]].
* '''Suggest new topics to write'''  <br/>If you have a good idea for an article that could be included but don't have the time or skills to write it yourself, it is still worth putting the idea forward. [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_2_communicate_with_the_online_community|Send a message]] that outlines the topic and scope of the article.
* '''Improve internal documentation''' <br/>If you research the [[WPD:Editors_Guide|Editor's Guide]] and you cannot find out how to do something, [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_2_communicate_with_the_online_community|propose an update to the Editor's Guide]] to make the process easier for other contributors.
* '''Rewriting CC-BY-SA content for CC-BY use'''  <br/>Content original to the site is licensed under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 3.0)] for maximum reusability. Some material on the site has been imported from other sources that have made it available under a share-alike license such as [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ CC-BY-SA].

=Advanced tasks=

Tasks in this section are often take longer to complete, require coordination with others in the community, or may require elevated access privileges in the wiki.

Presently we're building out a project management system using The Bug Genie (TBG), which will be the go-to site for all of our larger site-wide projects.

==Most wanted==
Items from the [[WPD:Most_Wanted_Tasks|Most Wanted Tasks]] page will be listed here once their status in TBG is determined, and the Most Wanted Tasks page will be deprecated in favor of this page and the TBG project management system.

==Projects==
We run a number of long-term projects for improving the wiki infrastructure and content. See [https://project.webplatform.org project.webplatform.org]] for more information. These projects are described also in the [[WPD:Projects|Projects]] page. More information about projects soon.

==Template Corps==
A small team of people with the requisite knowledge of SMW forms and templates is tasked with improving these for the wiki. See [[WPD:Community/Task_Force/Template_Corps|Template Corps]] for more information.
