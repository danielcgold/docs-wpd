It's easy to get started. Here are a few easy tasks that are great for beginners.

* '''Correct grammar and spelling mistakes''' Pages on [http://wpd.referata.com/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Style_Compatibility_Issue&namespace=10 this list] need some attention to fix grammar and spelling mistakes.
* '''Add examples'''
* '''Merge duplicate articles''' Every so often there will be pages that substantially duplicate content and should be merged into one. For example, an article that originally came from MSDN might have lots of overlapping content with another article that came from HTML5Rocks. Look for articles that have the '''Duplicate content''' label, and look through the two articles to ensure that all of the good content of the two articles is kept when they're merged into one.
* '''Add appropriate labels to pages that need help'''
* '''Suggest new topics for inclusion''' If you have a good idea for an article that could be included but don't have the time or skills to write it yourself, it is still worth putting the idea forward. You can do this in a variety of ways, for example my e-mailing ideas to XXXXXXXXXXXX, writing then down on the suggestion board at XXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
* '''Write new articles''' It is always great to see people writing new content. To find out what needs to be written, see the suggestion board. IF you are not sure if something needs to be written, ask about it first, at XXXXXXXXXXXX. If you haven't got time to write a complete article, it is still worth creating a new page with the beginnings of a new article on it.
* '''Welcome new users'''
