{{TODO | Create a simple starter guide to bringing in compatibility table information here }}

==Overview==
Compatibility information details which (CSS/HTML) features are supported by which browsers, as of which version.  This information is supposed to be in the {{TODO | insert}} section of the {{TODO | insert}} relevant pages.

The needed source information is available from the mozdev site {{TODO | insert link}}, and the basic details can be freely copied (permission already given).  This information typically says when that support started (or ended), and so rarely changes.

NOTE: Extended prose discussions on compatibility may have citation and reuse issues, and so must be avoided (without training beyond this Getting Started guideline).

Background -- this starter guide assumes that you are already registered with WPD and can edit wiki markup; use this {{TODO | insert}} link to get caught up.

The basic process flow (to be detailed below) is:
* locate and select an element that is missing Compatibility info
* check the item out for editing (tell others that you are working on it)
* look up the relevant info on mozdev
* extract the part that can be freely copied
* update the existing reference page with the Compatibility info
* check your work back in (note any gotchas, incompleteness, or issues, and let others know that your work is done and ready for review and/or use)

==Special instructions for the November Adobe Doc Sprint (temporary)==
* updating the task spreadsheet (google doc) {{TODO | insert link}}
* notifying the IRC {{TODO | insert link}}
