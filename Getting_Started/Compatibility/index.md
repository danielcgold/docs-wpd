{{TODO | Create a simple starter guide to bringing in compatibility table information here }}

==Overview==
"Compatibility Information" details which (CSS/HTML/JavaScript) features/APIs are supported by which browsers, as of which version.  Tables for this information are built into the templates for those elements, etc., and are automatically flagged as incomplete, which has them appear on a centralized list (http://docs.webplatform.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Template%3ACompat+Unknown&namespace=).

The needed source information is available from the Mozilla Developer Network site (http://developer.mozilla.org), and the basic factual details can be freely copied (permission already given).  This information typically says when that support started (or ended), and so rarely changes.

We are generally most concerned initially with getting the newer features covered, so http://caniuse.com is another valuable reference.

{{Note | Extended prose discussions on compatibility may have citation and reuse issues, and so must be avoided (without training beyond this Getting Started guideline).}}

Background -- this starter guide assumes that you are already registered with WPD and can edit wiki markup; use this {{TODO | insert}} link to get caught up.

The basic process flow (to be detailed below) is:
* locate and select an element that is missing Compatibility info
* check the item out for editing (tell others that you are working on it)
* look up the relevant info on mozdev
* extract the part that can be freely copied
* update the existing reference page with the Compatibility info
* check your work back in (note any gotchas, incompleteness, or issues, and let others know that your work is done and ready for review and/or use)

==Special instructions for the November Adobe Doc Sprint (temporary)==
* updating the task spreadsheet (google doc) {{TODO | insert link}}
* notifying the IRC {{TODO | insert link}}

==Add real and useful stuff here==
