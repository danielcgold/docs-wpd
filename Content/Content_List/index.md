This is a list of all the existing content that has been donated to the webplatform.org project. I (CHRIS MILLS) have broken it into '''batches''', of roughly the same size. For each batch, we need someone to take ownership of it, and then:

# Check that all the existing articles listed have been imported into the Wiki. Most of these will be done automatically using a batch import, but you may need to import some of them manually.
# Check the content structure for the subject you are currently dealing with. For anything that doesn't make sense, or needs adding, modifying or deleting, make changes as necessary.
# Fit existing articles into the content structure as well as you can. 
# Create new pages/stubs for articles that are yet to be written.
# Make sure all articles have the correct URLs and tags.
# Go through the list of items that must be added to each article before publishing (NEEDS FINISHING) and make sure they are added:
## browser compatibility
## flags
## license
## ??
# also need to proof/edit articles at some point

'''OWNER: CHRIS MILLS'''

'''Notes: There is some good material in this section, but a lot of it probably needs to be rejigged or trimmed, and a lot needs to be added. I don't think this section is as high a priority as the raw technology stuff, but we should still add stubs and leave it for the community to pick up, in the immediacy?'''

=== ARTICLE BATCH 3 ===

'''OWNER: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'''

'''Notes: Someone with a good knowledge of accessibility should handle this section, preferably someone from WAI, like Shawn. The WAI should at least be consulted, as I believe they have done some work on working out a11y content for webplatform.org already.'''

====Accessibility====

We've already got

# [http://www.w3.org/wiki/Accessibility_basics Accessibility basics] (Opera)
# [http://www.w3.org/wiki/Accessibility_testing Accessibility testing] (Opera)

But I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED OUT TO SEVERAL ARTICLES, TO COVER DIFFERENT ASPECTS, SOMETHING LIKE:

# WRITING A PLAN FOR A11Y TESTING, INCLUDING USE OF REAL USER TESTING, CONFORMANCE CRITERIA, AUTOMATED TOOLS, AND GOOD OLD COMMON SENSE
# THE LEGAL SIDE OF THINGS, EXPLAINED IN DETAIL
# DECIPHERING WCAG, AND OTHER CONFORMANCE CRITERIA SUCH AS SECTION 508
# ACCESSIBILITY TOOLS, WHAT TO USE AND WHAT TO AVOID. HOW FAR WILL THESE GET YOU?
# REAL A11Y TESTING WITH REAL PEOPLE, HOW TO PUT TOGETHER FOCUS GROUPS, WHAT TO LOOK FOR HERE
# COMMON SENSE - SOLUTIONS FOR COMMON ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES - A ROADMAP FOR FIXING ISSUES. START WITH SEMANTIC HTML, THEN GO TO VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT, JAVASCRIPT, AJAX, ALTERNATIVES. }

PROPOSED STRUCTURE

# [[Mobile beginnings: An introduction to the mobile web]] (include history of mobiles, how mobile networks work, what the hardware looks like, what the software looks like)
# [[What do the devices look like?]] (a fairly detailed reference showing the types of devices you are likely to need to support when building cross device adaptive apps. Include data such as screen resolution, espect ratio and dpi of the different devices. This kid of reference material will be very useful to developers.)
# [[Mobile constraints and advantages]] (what are the specific constraints you need to work around for mobile and alternative browsing devices? What are the advantages, eg the context specific technologies you can take advantage of?)
# [[Mobile friendly: web design and development Overview]] (start with a basis of semantic HTML, accessibility best practices are Making an app or site mobile friendly - do you create a different site, or do you adapt your existing site for mobile? A brief introduction to Adaptive design - graceful degradation, progressive enhancement, using media queries and viewport to adapt layout, using feature detection to server appropriate content and services, geolocation, multimedia, offline apps, don't use browser sniffing!) A lot of this will be covered elsewhere.
# Feature detection, polyfilling, graceful degredation, etc. An article on this would be good, maybe something which showed how to detect for all different features. Kind of like Mark Pilgrims' No bullshit guide to detecting everything. Before he took it all down.
# MOBILE/DEVICE TESTING

OTHER THINGS TO ADD ELSEWHERE IN THE MATERIAL

# WE SHOULD WRITE AN ARTICLE TITLED "ONE WEB, MANY DEVICES", PLACED INSIDE http://www.w3.org/wiki/Web_Standards_Curriculum#Introduction_to_the_world_of_web_standards
# WE SHOULD ALSO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT SEMANTICS AND DIVERSE DEVICES IN http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_web_standards_model_-_HTML_CSS_and_JavaScript

===== SVG BASICS =====

# ''History and usage'' : As for HTML, it could be good to start by giving some context: What is it, Where does it come, What is it made for, How is it different than HTML? ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Introduction Introduction] from Mozilla)
# ''Syntax and deployment'' : This part would introduce the basic syntax, the concept of viewport and absolute positioning and finally how to embed an SVG document inside other language (basically HTML and CSS). ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started Simple example, basic properties, file types] from Mozilla)
# ''Basic shapes'' : This part will be dedicated to the basic shapes available in SVG ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes Basic Shapes] from Mozilla)
# ''Position and transformation'' : To go deeper inside the viewport thing and to explain the role of the transformations. ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Positions Positions] and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Transformations Basic transformations] from Mozilla)
# ''Using text in SVG'' ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Texts Texts] from Mozilla)
# ''Styling SVG'' : This is where we would detailed how to use presentation attributes and their CSS counterpart.
# ''Scripting SVG'' : Where we could introduce the SVG DOM API.

==== Part 2 : SVG ADVANCED ====

# ''How to build Pathes'' : To dig into the syntax of the d attribute on path elements ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Paths Paths] from Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes Fills and strokes]'' (Mozilla)
# ''Animating the web with SVG Animations'' : How to use SVG Animations
# ''SVG Filters'' : This would be an introduction to filters but each filters could have it's own article (Filters a really hard things) ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Filter_effects Filter effects] -- incomplete, from Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Clipping_and_masking Clipping and Masking]'' (Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Patterns Patterns]'' (Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients Gradients]'' (Mozilla)
# ''Dealing with the external'' : This part would be dedicated to the foreignObject element but also to links and images elements. ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Other_content_in_SVG Other content in SVG] from Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_Fonts SVG fonts]'' (Mozilla)
# ''[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_Image_Tag SVG image element]'' (Mozilla)
