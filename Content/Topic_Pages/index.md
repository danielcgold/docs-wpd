We have a number of landing pages implied by the [[WPD:Architecture]]. Most of them are captured in this migration tracking spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRs-89PKiZpdHBqN2poNnJjV1c0N1FCYlN3ZUtpZ3c#gid=34

This page documents how to go about creating them.

The primary goal of these landing pages is to make sure that users (and search engines!) know about all of the content we have hidden within the site. The secondary goal is to explain the concepts that unite them.

There are a few types of pages:

==Manually generated==

==Simple Sub-Directory==

==Query-generated==
