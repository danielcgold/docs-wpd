Most articles automatically maintain a history of all edits and who made them. However, some articles are seeded with already-comprehensive content that comes from external sites. Maintaining a link to the original content helps give credit to those sites, maintain a historical link to the original copy in case it is necessary in the future, and in some cases it is required by the license of the original source.

==Adding external attribution to an article==

External attribution for a site should be added to an article when:

* You are copying in text from an existing WPD article that contains external attribution (including when you are merging articles)
* You are directly copying in text, no matter how long, from a site that is already listed in the external attribution list, below. (Remember to always ensure the license of the origin site is compatible with copying the text to this site before copying, even for sites already on the external attribution list.)

To add external attribution to an article, choose "Edit with Form" and check off the applicable box in the bottom of the form. Providing the actual link is optional in most cases; if it's not provided it will default to the organization's information page on WPD.

'''Special note for Mozilla Developer Network content''': Mozilla Developer Network content is licensed under a CC-BY-SA license. If the article you are editing contains content originally from that site and the license has ''not'' [[WPD:Porting_MDN_Content | been converted to the WPD license]], you '''must check off the CC-BY-SA checkbox''' when editing the article and '''include a link to the original site.'''


==Canonical list of sites that are on the external attribution list==

The canonical list of external attribution sites will be maintained at [[Template:External_Attribution]] in the future. It will contain:
* [http://developer.mozilla.com MDN]
* [http://www.html5rocks.com HTML5Rocks]
* [http://www.MSDN.com MSDN]
* ''and some others''

This list will populate the article-editing form.

==Maintaining the list of external attribution sites==

The list of sites that can get external attribution is deliberately kept small. All items on the list should:
* Have at least five articles on WPD that would list that site for external attribution
* Be a well-regarded site that the community feels has valuable and accurate content.

If you believe that there is a site that fulfills these requirements that is not yet on the list, contact an administrator to have them add it to the canonical list.
