=Doc Sprint in a Box=
How to hold a doc sprint and live to tell the tale. [Still under construction; it's been a busy couple of weeks.]

==Whatâ€™s a Doc Sprint?==
This document describes the planning and execution of a Web Platform Doc Sprint. While a doc sprint may be as simple as a small group of people gathering at someone's house or as elaborate as a full-blown event at a public venue, with fifty or more people, catering, speakers, swag, etc., for the purposes of this document a doc sprint is:
:A pre-announced, free event open to the general public where a group of 10 or more people gather in one location at the same time to work on WebPlatform.org for an extended period and report the results of the work performed in a standard format.
This doesn't mean that a doc sprint can't be virtual or that it can't be a spontaneous event with fewer than 10 people. But most of the information in this guide won't apply to such smaller-scale doc sprints.

The key deliverable common to all doc sprints is the '''report''' of the work performed. That means publicizing the doc sprint ahead of time and reporting the results shortly after the doc sprint. It's like a tree falling in the forest; if nobody knows about the doc sprint, it didn't happen. Do good, and let others know about it!

==Goals of a Doc Sprint==
#'''Onboard contributors:''' Recruit and train new contributors to WebPlatform.org and lower the barrier to contribution
#'''Write content:''' Get as much work done on WebPlatform.org as possible
#'''Give feedback:''' Collect feedback on improvements to the platform
#'''Report:''' Inform the community about what has been accomplished, report the feedback and next steps
#'''Have a lot of fun!'''

==About this Guide==
This guide captures the learnings from past doc sprints and advises those planning to run their own doc sprints. Some of the deliverables described are optional. For example, if you're running a doc sprint at your house with a group of friends, you don't need a sponsor and may not need t-shirts, catering, etc. Simply use your own judgement and/or ask others via [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform-site IRC] and the [public-webplatform@w3.org public list] if in doubt.

Also, there are two ways to read this document. You could start with the General Considerations section or jump down to the more comprehensive Timeline, which puts things in order and links back to the considerations wherever needed.
