==Whatâ€™s a Doc Sprint?==
This document describes the planning and execution of a Web Platform Doc Sprint. While a doc sprint may be as simple as a small group of people gathering at someone's house or as elaborate as a full-blown event at a public venue, with fifty or more people, catering, speakers, swag, etc., for the purposes of this document a doc sprint is:
A pre-announced, free event open to the general public where a group of 10 or more people gather in one location at the same time to work on WebPlatform.org for an extended period and report the results of the work performed in a standard format.
This doesn't mean that a doc sprint can't be virtual or that it can't be a spontaneous event with fewer than 10 people. But most of the information in this guide won't apply to such smaller-scale doc sprints.
