=Doc Sprint in a Box=
How to hold a doc sprint and live to tell the tale. [Still under construction; it's been a busy couple of weeks.]

==What’s a Doc Sprint?==
This document describes the planning and execution of a Web Platform Doc Sprint. While a doc sprint may be as simple as a small group of people gathering at someone's house or as elaborate as a full-blown event at a public venue, with fifty or more people, catering, speakers, swag, etc., for the purposes of this document a doc sprint is:
:A pre-announced, free event open to the general public where a group of 10 or more people gather in one location at the same time to work on WebPlatform.org for an extended period and report the results of the work performed in a standard format.
This doesn't mean that a doc sprint can't be virtual or that it can't be a spontaneous event with fewer than 10 people. But most of the information in this guide won't apply to such smaller-scale doc sprints.

The key deliverable common to all doc sprints is the ''report of the work performed''. That means publicizing the doc sprint ahead of time and reporting the results shortly after the doc sprint. It's like a tree falling in the forest: if nobody knows about the doc sprint, it didn't happen. Do good, and let others know about it!

==Goals of a Doc Sprint==
#'''Onboard contributors:''' Recruit and train new contributors to WebPlatform.org and lower the barrier to contribution
#'''Write content:''' Get as much work done on WebPlatform.org as possible
#'''Give feedback:''' Collect feedback on improvements to the platform
#'''Report:''' Inform the community about what has been accomplished, report the feedback and next steps
#'''Have a lot of fun!'''

==About this Guide==
This guide captures the learnings from past doc sprints and advises those planning to run their own doc sprints. Some of the deliverables described are optional. For example, if you're running a doc sprint at your house with a group of friends, you don't need a sponsor and may not need t-shirts, catering, etc. Simply use your own judgement and/or ask others via [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform-site IRC] and the [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org public list] if in doubt.

Also, there are two ways to read this document. You could start with the [[#General Considerations|General Considerations]] section or jump down to the more comprehensive [[#Timeline|Timeline]] section, which puts things in order and links back to the considerations wherever needed.

==General Considerations==
===Event Roles===
There should be at least two people in primary roles running the doc sprint (you can assign more than one person per role):
*Logistics Coordinator
*Content Coordinator

The '''Logistics Coordinator''' will focus on all things needed to make the event happen, such as coordinating location, staff, catering, front-door reception, or life-saver stuff such as contacting the local IT admin to deal with network issues. The person in this role can of course contribute content during the doc sprint; however, this person would prioritize (for example) organizing more beer for the crowd over answering content questions. The Logistics Coordinator's primary focus in terms of general goals is 1, 3, and 5: make contributors happy, report accomplishments, and generate fun.

The '''Content Coordinator''' will focus on general goals 2 and 4, content and structure: a plan for what the group will focus on, answering questions that contributors have about authoring content and working with the wiki, and guiding additional content coordinators to lead work groups and help organize the work for the day. As a rule of thumb, a ratio of up to 1:12, 1 coordinator guiding 12 contributors, works best. A work plan and related docs allow contributors to answer many questions themselves; see the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/community/zurich_aug_2013 Zurich plan] or the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/community/berlin_feb_2013 Berlin plan] as examples. We recommend a planning meeting of coordinators focused solely on content.

===Date===
Choosing the perfect date and time for your event is impossible. People prefer either to contribute on weekdays during work time, if their employer supports them, or on weekends, during their free time. Some like to work in the morning, some prefer the afternoon. Also, location, time of year, and other implications may apply. Consider the following:
*Decide if you are running a one- or two-day doc sprint. Two-day sprints may attract more attendees, if scheduled, for example, on Friday and Saturday (thereby including both a workday and a weekend day). Don’t separate the days into distinct events, but briefly repeat introductions and operating mechanisms on day two. Make it clear that participants don’t have to attend both.
*Try attaching your doc sprint to a bigger event, such as a conference. People are already in town and might be persuaded to add the doc sprint to their itineraries (see [[#Colocated Events|Colocated Events]]).
*Check in with folks on the [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform-site IRC] and the [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org public list] to see if your dates work for potential volunteers, experts, or attendees, and are in line with other WPD happenings.

===Location===
While it sounds like a rad idea to have a doc sprint on the beach, the intense sunlight, sand, and smear of suncream on laptops might be a problem. Other than the obivious, here are some things to consider when choosing a location:
*'''Power:''' People need electricity to run their laptops. Provide at least one power outlet per attendee (and maybe more, for their other devices), and make sure extension cords are available.
*'''Network:''' Other than power, this is by far the most important asset for your event. Remember: you will be working online. No network, no uplink, no doc sprint. Ensure the capacity of the LAN, WLAN, and uplink bandwidth are sufficient for your event. Where possible, use copper instead of WiFi. Have IT administrators on hand. You should not use a location where the network might collapse when your recruiting efforts are just a bit more successful than expected!
*'''Audio/Video:''' You will need A/V Equipment proper to your location to show slides and amplify presentations. Ideally this is available on premises. Remember the international power plug adapters!
*'''Security:''' Make it clear that everybody needs to mind his/her own belongings. If attendees need to sign in to enter the building, make sure you understand and communicate the process and, if necessary, hire a person to receive and authorize attendees at the front door; a [https://www.taskrabbit.com/ TaskRabbit] works well for this. 
*'''Catering:''' This depends on what you want/can provide for the event. The location may have its own kitchen and staff or you may have to work with an external contractor who brings the food, plates, and utensils. Watch out: some locations restrict you to their "own" (or union) contractors (i.e., they don’t allow you to call your favorite local pizza place); some won’t allow you to bring your own beer. Be sure you check this beforehand.
*'''Staff:''' While this might not be a location requirement, keep in mind that you will need people to take care of the aftermath of the doc sprint as well as the setup. It can help if this is provided by the location and thus a no-brainer for you, especially if you want to leave the location for drinks afterward instead of disassembling and cleaning up the place. Again, a TaskRabbit may work for this.
*'''Directions:''' Pick a location that can be reached easily. If it is not easily accessible, or has limitations like no parking spaces, be sure to communicate before hand (see [[#Registration and Communications|Registration and Communications]]). Provide a map to the event, with options for public transport, if possible.
*'''Facilities:''' Be sure there there are enough restrooms for the size of your group and that people can find the restrooms easily; put up signs with arrows if necessary. Provide separate areas where a few participants can gather for conversations. Think carefully about ''how many people can effectively work a whole day'' at the venue.

===Likely Venues===
*Company workspaces (after hours, or on weekends): this helps promote a company, and they are often happy to offer space
*Community centers
*Coworking spaces
*Conference venues (see [[#Colocated Events|Collocated Events]])
*Universities and other academic settings

==Colocated Events==
Consider scheduling a doc sprint close to a relevant, local event, such as a web development conference or W3C working group face-to-face meeting. You may be able to use some of the event space, or catering; you may be able to announce your doc sprint through the event's PR and announcements, and attract some of the same attendees. Scheduling your doc sprint before the main event might get better engagement than after (when everybody's head is about to explode, from the conference or the conference party, or both). On the other hand, many conferences are scheduled for the last two days of the week, so attendees are more likely to stay through Saturday, perhaps with some time to donate to WPD and the community.

However, be careful not to compete with any aspects of the main event, since attendees of that event are less likely to stick around to work at a doc sprint when there are other things to be done. Instead, organize the doc sprint on one of the subsequent days, or during a paid workshop day, or as a free event open to the public if the main event is for-pay.

Always be respectful to the main event organizers; do not undermine their goals, or draw people away from their event. Treat a doc sprint as a supplement, not a rival.

Here are two examples on collocated doc sprints of the past:
*As a workshop, prior to the regular event: [http://2013.frontendconf.ch/workshops/ http://2013.frontendconf.ch/workshops/]
*As a partner event, after the regular event: [http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten/2013/web-platform-doc-sprint http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten/2013/web-platform-doc-sprint]

In both examples, the conference helped to announce the doc sprint to attendees in its regular event communication with e-mails, tweets, and other messages. Also, a doc sprint and its world-wide visibility via the W3C and Web Platform Stewards PR can help a conference gain more visibility. This is a classic win-win and should be played as such, like a partnership.

==Attendee Benefits==
While it is already fun to contribute for the greater good, attendees appreciate other reasons to attend a doc sprint, such as the following:
*'''Recognition:''' Include your contributors' names in the results report and highlight outstanding accomplishments; also, encourage them to earn their Firestarter badges (added to their user pages with the tag "<nowiki>[[Image:css-firestarter-badge-simple.png]]</nowiki>" ).
*'''Swag:''' T-shirts, stickers, gadgets (possibly available through one of your sponsors, including the Web Platform Stewards) and the like should be available.
*'''Raffle prizes:''' Various tech-related goodies (possibly available through one of your sponsors, including the Web Platform Stewards). Make it clear that only contributors are eligible for the raffle.
*'''Catering:''' Try to provide at least free drinks and simple snacks such as fruits and energy bars. It's okay for attendees to break away independently for lunch, but remember that any time they leave the venue they may not come back.
*'''Networking:''' Foster people's information exchange by having a reception or party after your event. It should be easy to find a sponsor for drinks, and most of the nearby bars are happy to keep open a corner for 10, 30, or 60 customers as long as you prearrange it with th em. Make sure the organizers and speakers are available to attendees as much as possible.
*'''Meeting notable people:''' Similar to networking, if you have notable attendees, many people will enjoy meeting them; these might be specification editors, or well-known developers or designers. For some people, even just meeting and working alongside someone from the stewards group may be exciting.

==Registration and Communications==
===General Advice===
*Come any time! Stay as long as you want! Emphasize this in all communication. Many people won't come to a doc sprint because they think that they have to be there all day.
*The doc sprint is an introduction; you want participants to stay involved, even if you can only contribute a little bit at a time.
*Advise people to bring their own computers and ''especially a power adaptor''. Send a reminder 24 hours before the event just for this! Make this very clear, and have it as one of the first items people will read in your communication; attendees have showed up without a computer to work on in the past! 
*Ask attendees not to run their own hotspots, but invite them to use own cellular data for secondary devices so they come prepared.
*Ask people to return tickets (especially on free events) if they cannot make it to the event. Include this in '''all''' communications but make sure to send out a '''dedicated''' message asking people to free up vacant tickets some days before the event so you can align catering.
*Ask people to add themselves to any helpful social media service you are using, such as [http://www.lanyrd.com Lanyrd] or [http://www.meetup.com Meetup]. Provide these links to attendees. 
*If you are using [http://www.eventbrite.com Eventbrite], use the survey feature to run three questions against registrants: 
**Have you already added yourself to our Lanyrd page at <provide URL>?
**Do you have any food requirements (vegetarian, allergies)?
**What is your t-shirt size (if you plan to provide such swag)?
*Make sure to provide a contact for people to ask questions.
*Provide links to registration pages. 
**Here is the [https://wpds-zurich.eventbrite.com/ Zurich] page.
**Here is the [http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/109202662/ San Francisco] page.
*Share any links to the announcement and registration pages to the [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org WPD public list].
*The hashtag we used for Web Platform Doc Sprints in the past is <nowiki>#WPDS</nowiki>; be sure to let your attendees know ahead of time and on the day of the event. And ask them to be active on social media! Other useful social media strings are:
**Google Plus: +WebPlatform Docs
**@WebPlatform
**<nowiki>#WPDS</nowiki>
*If you want to collect images taken by attendees, consider announcing a specific location, service, or tag to use while posting. It makes reporting much easier!

===Surveys===
Follow up the doc sprint with a quick survey.
*Here's the [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TRl4lb-zVzf0_ggSKGYklv3U1NDEBHER6PPynErojYM/edit?usp=sharing survey template].
*Make a copy of this template and rename it for your doc sprint, for example, "WPDS - Amsterdam, Oct. 12, 2013".
*Here is the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Survey WPD Survey page].
*Some event registration systems offer survey capabilities, and you can also create a Google Form for this purpose.

===Thank-You Note===
Be sure to provide thank-you notes to attendees. Here is one from a previous sprint:
:''Thank you for attending the Web Platform Documentation Sprint last November. With your hard work we made over 800 changes to the site!''
:''Because it was such a great event, we'd like to let you know that we will be hosting another Web Platform Doc Sprint next month and we hope you will once again decide to participate.''

===Registration Fees===
Please note that doc sprints are meant to be free events! If you can’t afford the space or catering, please consider asking a steward or other sponsor to help fund the event; please do not charge attendees for the event, as that violates expectations and trust in the community. Participants are volunteers.

===Registration Numbers and No-Shows===
A normal range of registrants can vary widely. Depending on the size of the venue and the success of advertising, you can usually count on 30–100 registrants, with an actual attendance rate of 40–50% (i.e., 50–60% of people registering will not show up). 

On the day of the event, '''send out a note to all no-shows'''.
*Tell them the doc sprint just kicked off, and "here is how you can participate if you did not make it to the event". 
*You can point them to the work plan (see the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/community/zurich_aug_2013 Zurich plan], for example) created by the Content Coordinator.
