=Doc Sprint in a Box=
How to hold a doc sprint and live to tell the tale. [Still under construction; it's been a busy couple of weeks.]

==What’s a Doc Sprint?==
This document describes the planning and execution of a Web Platform Doc Sprint. While a doc sprint may be as simple as a small group of people gathering at someone's house or as elaborate as a full-blown event at a public venue, with fifty or more people, catering, speakers, swag, etc., for the purposes of this document a doc sprint is:
:A pre-announced, free event open to the general public where a group of 10 or more people gather in one location at the same time to work on WebPlatform.org for an extended period and report the results of the work performed in a standard format.
This doesn't mean that a doc sprint can't be virtual or that it can't be a spontaneous event with fewer than 10 people. But most of the information in this guide won't apply to such smaller-scale doc sprints.

The key deliverable common to all doc sprints is the '''report''' of the work performed. That means publicizing the doc sprint ahead of time and reporting the results shortly after the doc sprint. It's like a tree falling in the forest: if nobody knows about the doc sprint, it didn't happen. Do good, and let others know about it!

==Goals of a Doc Sprint==
#'''Onboard contributors:''' Recruit and train new contributors to WebPlatform.org and lower the barrier to contribution
#'''Write content:''' Get as much work done on WebPlatform.org as possible
#'''Give feedback:''' Collect feedback on improvements to the platform
#'''Report:''' Inform the community about what has been accomplished, report the feedback and next steps
#'''Have a lot of fun!'''

==About this Guide==
This guide captures the learnings from past doc sprints and advises those planning to run their own doc sprints. Some of the deliverables described are optional. For example, if you're running a doc sprint at your house with a group of friends, you don't need a sponsor and may not need t-shirts, catering, etc. Simply use your own judgement and/or ask others via [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform-site IRC] and the [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org public list] if in doubt.

Also, there are two ways to read this document. You could start with the [[#General Considerations|General Considerations]] section or jump down to the more comprehensive [[#Timeline|Timeline]] section, which puts things in order and links back to the considerations wherever needed.

==General Considerations==
===Event Roles===
There should be at least two people in primary roles running the doc sprint (you can assign more than one person per role):
*Logistics Coordinator
*Content Coordinator

The '''Logistics Coordinator''' will focus on all things needed to make the event happen, such as coordinating location, staff, catering, front-door reception, or life-saver stuff such as contacting the local IT admin to deal with network issues. The person in this role can of course contribute content during the doc sprint; however, this person would prioritize (for example) organizing more beer for the crowd over answering content questions. The Logistics Coordinator's primary focus in terms of general goals is 1, 3, and 5: make contributors happy, report accomplishments, and generate fun.

The '''Content Coordinator''' will focus on general goals 2 and 4, content and structure: a plan for what the group will focus on, answering questions that contributors have about authoring content and working with the wiki, and guiding additional content coordinators to lead work groups and help organize the work for the day. As a rule of thumb, a ratio of up to 1:12, 1 coordinator guiding 12 contributors, works best. A work plan and related docs allow contributors to answer many questions themselves; see the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/community/zurich_aug_2013 Zurich plan] or the [http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/community/berlin_feb_2013 Berlin plan] as examples. We recommend a planning meeting of coordinators focused solely on content.

===Date===
Choosing the perfect date and time for your event is impossible. People prefer either to contribute on weekdays during work time, if their employer supports them, or on weekends, during their free time. Some like to work in the morning, some prefer the afternoon. Also, location, time of year, and other implications may apply. Consider the following:
*Decide if you are running a one- or two-day doc sprint. Two-day sprints may attract more attendees, if scheduled, for example, on Friday and Saturday (thereby including both a workday and a weekend day). Don’t separate the days into distinct events, but briefly repeat introductions and operating mechanisms on day two. Make it clear that participants don’t have to attend both.
*Try attaching your doc sprint to a bigger event, such as a conference. People are already in town and might be persuaded to add the doc sprint to their itineraries. (See [[#Colocated Events|Colocated Events]].)
*Check in with folks on the [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform-site IRC] and the [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org public list] to see if your dates work for potential volunteers, experts, or attendees, and are in line with other WPD happenings.

===Location===
While it sounds like a rad idea to have a doc sprint on the beach, the intense sunlight, sand, and smear of suncream on laptops might be a problem. Other than the obivious, here are some things to consider when choosing a location:
*'''Power:''' People need electricity to run their laptops. Provide at least one power outlet per attendee (and maybe more, for their other devices), and make sure extension cords are available.
*'''Network:''' Other than power, this is by far the most important asset for your event. Remember: you will be working online. No network, no uplink, no doc sprint. Ensure the capacity of the LAN, WLAN, and uplink bandwidth are sufficient for your event. Where possible, use copper instead of WiFi. Have IT administrators on hand. You should not use a location where the network might collapse when your recruiting efforts are just a bit more successful than expected!
*'''Audio/Video:''' You will need A/V Equipment proper to your location to show slides and amplify presentations. Ideally this is available on premises. Remember the international power plug adapters!
*'''Security:''' Make it clear that everybody needs to mind his/her own belongings. If attendees need to sign in to enter the building, make sure you understand and communicate the process and, if necessary, hire a person to receive and authorize attendees at the front door; a [https://www.taskrabbit.com/ TaskRabbit] works well for this. 
*'''Catering:''' This depends on what you want/can provide for the event. The location may have its own kitchen and staff or you may have to work with an external contractor who brings the food, plates, and utensils. Watch out: some locations restrict you to their "own" (or union) contractors (i.e., they don’t allow you to call your favorite local pizza place); some won’t allow you to bring your own beer. Be sure you check this beforehand.
*'''Staff:''' While this might not be a location requirement, keep in mind that you will need people to take care of the aftermath of the doc sprint as well as the setup. It can help if this is provided by the location and thus a no-brainer for you, especially if you want to leave the location for drinks afterward instead of disassembling and cleaning up the place. Again, a TaskRabbit may work for this.
*'''Directions:''' Pick a location that can be reached easily. If it is not easily accessible, or has limitations like no parking spaces, be sure to communicate before hand (see [[#Registration and Communications|Registration and Communications]]). Provide a map to the event, with options for public transport, if possible.
*'''Facilities:''' Be sure there there are enough restrooms for the size of your group and that people can find the restrooms easily; put up signs with arrows if necessary. Provide separate areas where a few participants can gather for conversations. Think carefully about ''how many people can effectively work a whole day'' at the venue.
