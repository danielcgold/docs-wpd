We plan to have several documentation sprints to work on integrating the content on the WebPlatform.org site. There are many benefits to getting people together in physically for this sort of work, both for effective collaboration and for community-building.

==Schedule==
* '''Two Weeks After Roll-Out:''' a virtual sprint two weeks after the site opens
* '''August 10-15, 2012:''' [http://openhelpconference.com/ Open Help conference] in Cincinnati, OH
* '''September ?, 2012:''' distributed face-to-face sprint
* ??

==Logistics==
A virtual sprint can be organized on fairly short notice–participants just need to commit and clear their schedules. An in-person sprint requires more lead time and logistics; without a definite date for the site roll-out, it's hard to tie a date for an in-person sprint to that date.

Instead, we plan to attempt an in-person sprint in connection with the [http://openhelpconference.com/ Open Help conference] in August. Mozilla did an MDN doc sprint at Open Help last year, with good results.  We will be contacting Shaun McCance, the organizer, about this possibility.

After the first F2F sprint, we plan to keep the momentum going by holding a distributed documentation sprint, where we provide a phone/VOIP bridge for locals gathering togethr in small groups to focus on documentation.

==Planning Guide==
Janet Swisher started a [https://developer.mozilla.org/Project:en/Doc_sprint_planning_guide doc sprint planning guide].

There is also the [http://booki.flossmanuals.net/book-sprints/_draft/_v/1.0/introduction/ FLOSS Manuals Book Sprints book]; it's only available in draft form, because Adam Hyde considers it out of date with regard to his current philosophy on book sprints, but it should be helpful as far as the practical issues.

==Next Steps==
* Determine a budget and funding sources
* Draft a list of participants
* Pick an organizer and a facilitator
* Decide whether to do it

These are all inter-related. The go/no-go decision depends on the budget and funding, which depends in part on the participants, etc.

==Organizer Roles==
There should be at least two roles for organizers in a sprint: one person to organize the logistics, and another to facilitate the content effort. A single person doing both is too draining.

===Logistics Organizer===
This person should manage the budget and funding, find a location, identify participants, arrange meals, and so on.

===Content Facilitator===
This person should facilitate the content effort by guiding the creation and review of different materials, and encouraging colloboration between participation.

====Recommended Facilitators====
Janet recommend Adam Hyde of FLOSS Manuals, as he has more experience at this than really anybody. She mentioned the possibility of a sprint to him when the web docs project was first starting, and he was interested (even though we won't be using FLOSS Manuals site or producing a "book" per se). She has offered to reach out to him again, now that we're getting more definite about doing a sprint. She thinks his consulting rate is about 1000 euro per day, plus expenses.

==Participants==
For the face-to-face doc sprint, small groups of 8-12 in-person participants seem to work best; much less than that risks a lack of momentum, and with more than that, the group gets unwieldy. 

We want only one representative from each steward organization, along with community volunteers; otherwise, we risk filling the room with stewards and excluding community. However, the volunteers should be “known” and already-engaged people; we do not plan a general open call for participants. Members of the WebEd CG and the MDN community would be good candidates.

==Budget==
The budget needs to cover travel, lodging, and food for participants. If Open Help works like last year, they will provide meeting space for each sprint group during the sprint, so that's covered. It's helpful if participants all stay at the same place, so they're not splitting off to different accommodations, but that's not a necessity.

Steward organizations can obviously pay for their own participants; for example, Janet Swisher is planning in any case to offer sponsorship to members of MDN's community to attend the conference part of Open Help. But there are shared expenses like the facilitator's fee, and sponsorship for volunteer participants, so the funding for those expenses needs to be determined.
