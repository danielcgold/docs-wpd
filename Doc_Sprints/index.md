We plan to have ongoing documentation sprints to work on integrating the content on the WebPlatform.org site. There are many benefits to getting people together in physically for this sort of work, both for effective collaboration and for community-building.

==Schedule==
* '''3 November 2012''' San Francisco Doc Sprint at Adobe
* '''12 December 2012:''' Mountain View Doc Sprint at Google
* '''23-FEB-2013'''—WebPlatform Doc Sprint at Adobe in San Francisco, California, USA. [Registration TBD]
* Who's next?

==Logistics==
A virtual sprint can be organized on fairly short notice–participants just need to commit and clear their schedules. An in-person sprint requires more lead time and logistics. See the Web Platform Doc Sprint in a Box document for more information on how to organize an in-person doc sprint.

==Planning Guide==
Janet Swisher started a [https://developer.mozilla.org/Project:en/Doc_sprint_planning_guide doc sprint planning guide].

There is also the [http://booki.flossmanuals.net/book-sprints/_draft/_v/1.0/introduction/ FLOSS Manuals Book Sprints book]; it's only available in draft form, because Adam Hyde considers it out of date with regard to his current philosophy on book sprints, but it should be helpful as far as the practical issues.

==Organizer Roles==
There should be at least two roles for organizers in a sprint: one person to organize the logistics, and another to facilitate the content effort. A single person doing both is too draining.

===Logistics Organizer===
This person should manage the budget and funding, find a location, identify participants, arrange meals, and so on.

===Content Facilitator===
This person should facilitate the content effort by guiding the creation and review of different materials, and encouraging colloboration between participation.

====Recommended Facilitators====
Janet recommend Adam Hyde of FLOSS Manuals, as he has more experience at this than really anybody. She mentioned the possibility of a sprint to him when the web docs project was first starting, and he was interested (even though we won't be using FLOSS Manuals site or producing a "book" per se). She has offered to reach out to him again, now that we're getting more definite about doing a sprint. She thinks his consulting rate is about 1000 euro per day, plus expenses.

==Participants==
For the face-to-face doc sprint, small groups of 8-12 in-person participants seem to work best; much less than that risks a lack of momentum, and with more than that, the group gets unwieldy. 

We want only one representative from each steward organization, along with community volunteers; otherwise, we risk filling the room with stewards and excluding community. However, the volunteers should be “known” and already-engaged people; we do not plan a general open call for participants. Members of the WebEd CG and the MDN community would be good candidates.
