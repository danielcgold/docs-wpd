title: WPD:Doc Sprints
---
<p>We have ongoing documentation sprints to work on integrating the content on the WebPlatform.org site. There are many benefits to getting people together in physically for this sort of work, both for effective collaboration and for community-building.

<p>See (and probably "watch") the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Community_Events">Community Events page</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Logistics">Logistics</span></h2>
<p>A virtual sprint can be organized on fairly short noticeâ€“participants just need to commit and clear their schedules. An in-person sprint requires more lead time and logistics. We're working on extending this document to a Web Platform Doc Sprint in-a-Box document for more information on how to organize an in-person Doc Sprint.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Planning_Guide">Planning Guide</span></h2>
<p>Janet Swisher started a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/Project:en/Doc_sprint_planning_guide">Doc Sprint planning guide</a>.
</p><p>There is also the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://booki.flossmanuals.net/book-sprints/_draft/_v/1.0/introduction/">FLOSS Manuals Book Sprints book</a>; it's only available in draft form, because Adam Hyde considers it out of date with regard to his current philosophy on book sprints, but it should be helpful as far as the practical issues.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organizer_Roles">Organizer Roles</span></h2>
<p>There should be at least two roles for organizers in a sprint: one person to organize the logistics, and another to facilitate the content effort. A single person doing both is too draining.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Logistics_Organizer">Logistics Organizer</span></h3>
<p>This person should manage the budget and funding, find a location, identify participants, arrange meals, and so on.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Content_Facilitator">Content Facilitator</span></h3>
<p>This person should facilitate the content effort by guiding the creation and review of different materials, and encouraging collaboration between participants.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommended_Facilitators">Recommended Facilitators</span></h4>
<p>Janet recommend Adam Hyde of FLOSS Manuals, as he has more experience at this than really anybody. (even though we won't be using FLOSS Manuals site or producing a "book" per se). Contact Janet for an introduction to Adam.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Participants">Participants</span></h2>
<p>We want at best one representative from each steward organization, along with community volunteers; otherwise, we risk filling the room with stewards and excluding community.

<p><b>Doc Sprint dashboard</b>: There is a dashboard available that helps to monitor Doc Sprint results and inspires people to keep the momentum over the event. It fetches the Media Wiki API for latest changes and narrows down the data based on a given list of usernames (== Doc Sprint participants) and timeframe, which is then visualized in configurably graphs and leaderboards.
