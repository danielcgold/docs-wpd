===DISCUSSION===

====TOPIC: Demian Borba of Blackberry and his university program====

Demian Borba has a webkit implementation in our phone

* … focusing on HTML5
* … want to make developers successful
* … started a program called Blackberry Tech Center
* … Brazil, Argentina, US
* … find professors, pick 10 tech students to sponsor
* … could donate 20% of time to Web Platform Docs
* … in Brazil, we have 5 tech centers
* …. 1 in Argentina, Mexico, US

WPD could do project demand for them; provide a weekly structure and set of directions, that would be great.

Students are comfortable in EN and comfortable editing articles?

Students could also help with software? Kuma, Gollem & GitHub? Some tech centers that are really focused on UX, another on trolling & APIs, for example: blackberry command lines were moved to a UI.

It would be great to have them first work on content so they understand the work flow and requirements, and since they're ready to go

Community Dev folks will meet with Demian next week. And he can get them to meet once we have execution plan 

Millo is looking forward to Tuesdays meeting, can bring in MS similar programs, let's federate the students!

we meant to put things together earlier, having a set plan in place will give us consistency, we can write blog posts in advance

…also folks can do things in advance and have it done by the designated week.

…NicDaCosta is in EU; announcing at 11am on Wednesday PDT, kills it for EU; asked that we announce it late Tuesday night, early Wednesday morning

..so folks can do it on Wednesday.

====TOPIC: Japanese email list====

===Discussion===
====TOPIC: DevOps====

Recruiting is going slowly.


====TOPIC WPW====

coordinators should socialize the list each week

coordinators need more time to reach out to contributors: do topics earlier



problem: many people are not joining the e-mail list

A lot of people already have email overload.

project.webplatform.org was partially to cure that; there people can jump on and join an issue's discussion
jswisher said mail list is not part of site: not one experience; psychological barrier to "subscribing to an e-mail list"

http://www.discourse.org/ contextual chatting

But, we already have a few systems up that don't talk well with one another.

Garbee is working on an actual working Proof of Concept for a new 'wiki' engine. He will share his PoC next week.


Denis spent some time trying to get Kuma to work. Persona was a block.


We couldn't figure out how to make a page in Kuma

If Kuma is worth it, could someone help us from the Kuma community?

Imagine this as our editor: http://jejacks0n.github.io/mercury/

[09:25:07] <julee> jswisher: devs are helpful, but doesn't know about how things would work from the outside.

 scottrowe worked with mindtouch before http://www.mindtouch.com/


we're not going to move forward on a system without having a dedicated devops person.

ACTION: shepazu: get ahold of Kuma to get an evaluation copy going


Garbee is trying to rope people in from other communities he frequents. A few have shown interest in helping and at least one has already started (brbcoding).

go on IRC and ask: who's here right who can help

what are the 100 folks on webplatform doing? Lurking.

We also had major noise/spam issues right after launch. So, in us trying to control those issues we may have scared people off.


IRC people don't like to be told what specifically to discuss. If you are too strict on things, you end up like #html and people don't like you too much.

====TOPC: Topic clusters done with instrux?====

scottrowe has the Action item to of a proposal to create a new set of topic clusters that are pertinent to the page type

we need clusters that are relevant to the page type: CSS properties, API, HTML

How do we get a specific topic cluster type form field into each page type?

scottrowe: we think we can do this, but in the short term, we'll have to have folks put manual links


====TOPIC: WPW Video====

scottrowe has instrux in the video script

 julee: get a checklist out of script for folks to follow?
ACTION: scottrowe to derive a checklist from the video script for editing CSS properties


ACTION: scottrowe to send out script to a couple of folks to get feedback before taping.

ACTION: scottrowe will tape next week.

====TOPIC: spam====

600+ spam pages
should Admins approve new user creation?

ACTION: Garbee and shepazu to get a captcha system that works.


[09:58:45] <Garbee> I'd set it up with Questy (with custom questions/answers) to start.

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:QuestyCaptcha --Something like the first example code.


We also need to improve abusefilters.

Garbee is working with MicroFormats on sharing stuff once they get their system online.

Jswisher said MDN watches the revisions feed and has a dedicated delete; switching to persona has helped - although it might be a temporary effect; Persona for auth is actually a pretty good helper. It, like oAuth, is harder to fake outright.

===Action Items===

* shepazu to send email to most active users
* shepazu to reach out to Kuma ops (Aly).
* shepazu to post on job sites and sysops lists
* julee to ask direct and actionable question on IRC at 11am



==Agenda 2013-05-24==

* Roll call
* Review of open action items
* [http://docs.webplatform.org/test/css/properties/border-radius ToC]
* [[Meta:web_platform_wednesday|WPDW]] - how is it going?
** New and improved: only one table to fill out! (Master page is what we're pulling from. But http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday will become the final master list.)
** We have a standing IRC meeting at 11am PDT, Wednesdays, on #webplatform -- but nothing seems to be happening there.
*** We should be active on IRC at that time, at least promoting the current week's blog post, and let folks know we're available to answer any questions at that time.
** What is workflow for WPDWs?
**# Shepazu to pick topic.
**# Blog written on Tuesday, promo'd Wednesday morning.
**# Coordinators get volunteers and sign folks up on the WPW page, adding "In Progress"
**# Coordinators help contributors do properties.
**# Coordinators should update tables by Tuesday, with "Done" or "Not done".
** Anyone going to [http://cssconf.com/ CSSConf]? Any opportunity to promote WPW?
* [[WPD:Project_Status|Getting to Beta]]
** The bug genie is returning connection errors. Seems to be associated with writing certain files.
** How to mark bugs that are not in beta - postponed?
* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao_fDuA-PPFydE9vbkR4UWpPRHNjaGFxcjA5WXd5SVE#gid=0 changing www page to focus on community]
* Embedding external pages in WPD? (If Lea's not here, move to next week.)
* Anything blocking you from creating great content?
* Anything new & notable? (Blogs or other communications planned for next week?)

===DISCUSSION===
====TOPIC: Scott to do a video on how to do a CSS property====
It would be cool if people could share tips about doing CSS properties for the video
If we tell people to not fill in compat table information, make sure to emphasize the compat NOTES section
Let's talk about more examples for video, too.


We can easily do other ones in the future about how to edit wiki, contribute, etc

====TOPIC: ToC====

mockup: http://docs.webplatform.org/test/css/properties/border-radius

Lea pulled ToC out to the side.

Suggestions on how to make it better, but acceptable to deploy for now? Yes.


====TOPIC: Web Platform Wednesdays====
 http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday


now coordinators have only one table to update.

Shepazu is still tweeking it.

Stuff that doesn't get done, gets pushed to next week, or goes back to the hopper to come back in later weeks.

coordinator's job is NOT to do all these tasks. The corodinator is supposed to go out and actively recruit people to work on their items. If they can't get anybody, then sure work on them themselves.

Master list of what hasn't been done:
http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/master_list  or https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRs-89PKiZpdE0xdm9Sb1ZvRW1ZRzMtWEdyU0Z4OEE#gid=14 

Master list of what has been done:
http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday 


ONLY COORDINATORS should fill out that table


Workflow is:

# Shepazu to pick topic.
# Blog written on Tuesday, promo'd Wednesday morning.
# Coordinators get volunteers and sign folks up on the WPW page, adding "In Progress"
# Coordinators help contributors do properties.
# Coordinators should update tables by Tuesday, with "Done" or "Not done".

We should get topic clusters determined more in advance? like two or three week out

Leaverou will speak about WPW at http://cssconf.com/

====TOPIC: landing page/home page for site====

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao_fDuA-PPFydE9vbkR4UWpPRHNjaGFxcjA5WXd5SVE#gid=0

General idea: current goal is to get people active, so show community activity!

Changes should be done incrementally.


====TOPIC: Beta====

Connection errors on project.webplatform.org are preventing triaging of bugs.

In order to easily and quickly view bugs for current milestone within each project's open bugs page, bugs that are not part of the beta should be set to postponed.


====TOPIC: Embedding external pages in WPD====

it would be cool if we could add screencaps from other pages
leaverou  got this from the cubic-bezier page, somebody added screencaps from my tool cubic-bezier.com. She asked him if he thought it was a good idea to embed the tool (assuming I added media queries to make it look good on small viewports). She's wondering if it's possible and allowed.



===ACTION ITEMS===

* julee to start thread on where new guides exist, where to link them to and what to call them (our Ed, Getting Started, WPW, and Coordinator's guides have confusing names and do not properly reference each other.)
* Scott to do a video on how to edit a CSS properties page.
* Leaverou to email about embedding a screencaps tool. (CARRIED FORWARD)
* shepazu to write up guide on what coordinators do on WPW
* leaverou to work on home page design, with the goal of highlighting community activity (CARRIED FORWARD)

==DISCUSSION==

===TOPIC: W3C accessibility folks to use our forums===


We need to ensure forums banner explicitly states it's for accessibility question only.

There is a cost to everything we maintain. We'd de-emphasize it from the site (well, we already have). The accessibility people have a dedicated, funded person to fund the boards.

=== TOPIC: WPD Wednesdays===

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday

====WPDW Status====

We're in good shape, 25 knocked out this week, someone committed for everything but outlines

jkomoros can't come next week because of I/O, but have it blocked on my calendar going forward

Let's remember to send out inspirational articles when we blog about topics we're focusing on.

Weekly cycle is over on Tuesday.


====Do all pages need a different reviewer? At least a "peer" review? ====

Important that the person who reviews the page is not the person who worked on it.

Review shouldn't come across as too much of a blocker. Don't want it to be counter productive

Informal coordinator review, peer review, with official tech review later in 1.0 perfect cycle. We should not declare failure if we don't get review. Set review flag, and reviewers clear it. When flags are removed, that shows the pages are the quality that should be standard

Peer review to make sure the checklist is taken care of.
Coordinator can do the checklist review

If the coordinator can't do it, maybe just pair writers together

Technical review for correctness and example is correct

Two different levels of review might make the procedure too long winded. Expert review should come later, if needed.


The whole point of this exercise is to... get the work done, but mainly to grow contributor base, make it clear how to contribute.

some people have already spoken up and started contributing because this makes it easier. Don't take the work away from other people if you can help develop them. It will take some effort to get people into the habit of contributing and building up the contributor base

==== Coordinators responsibilities====

Doug is working on a coordinator's guide

WPDW will be on #webplatform NOT #webplatform-site


All coordinators should:

* update WPDW main page with assigned items having check marks
* update this week's page with status
* update master list when things are done

Coordinators should still do one page. That helps them understand what the pain points are.

Coordinators have 1 or 2 volunteers for each WPDW

When we have a short-hand property that encompasses all of the other properties for individual settings

That's why we chose more properties this week, to keep shorthand/longhand sets together. One person can write the individual longhand properties (which may be in more than one shorthand property), and then do the short hand version.

A lot of pages in mine that said, "just see short hand page". That's annoying to click through. Because we don't have transclusion, we should copy paste.


===TOPIC: Getting to beta===

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Meetings/General#Project_Status

The project leads to review the criteria and update the bugs
Extended deadline until mid week next week

===TOPIC: Onboarding===

Need a stock response to people like Konstantinos who reach out to the list and want to join. And maybe a rotating member of the community team to send them?

Eliot: We're getting a regular stream of new people, asking how they can help. We need a stock mail to send out, and someone on point to respond

people should feel comfortable to customize it.

Tell them that wiki wednesday is a great way to get started

==Agenda 2013-05-03==

* Roll call
* Review of open action items
* [[WPD:Project_Status|Getting to Beta]]
** We assigned project owners. Those owners should review the beta criteria and update it with what their "group" thinks should be in the beta. 
** Beta criteria needs to be clarified at the higher level as well. For example:
*** [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2013Apr/0370.html Scott's take]
*** We need more folks vetting the content that's there. The community TF will do a recruiting plan.
*** We need folks to work on content, especially CSS properties pages. We may ask folks to own certain portions, to be divvied up amongst their friends and family, or otherwise focus on that.
*** For each content area, we should have exemplar content
*** Each page should be clearly designated as either ready to consume or needing additional contributions.
** What you can do:
*** If you're a project leader:
**** discuss beta criteria with stakeholders and update the Project Status page.
**** make sure you have tasks and bugs relating to beta in project.webplatform.org, and that they're assigned to someone.
**** if you find blockers, file a bug, and broadcast it to the public list
*** If you're an individual contributor:
**** work on some CSS properties
**** if you find blockers, file a bug, and broadcast it to the public list
* CSS Properties pages

==DISCUSSION==

===TOPIC: Beta===

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Meetings/General
http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Project_Status
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2013Apr/0370.html

About Beta: we aren't out of the woods until we get to Beta, at that point, we can be comfortable saying "use this content". That's the critical mass point. Watching all the sub-task forces doing their work, it's great, but imagine that there's a day when stewards or others leave and it starts a mass exodus. Get to critical mass: instead of doing so across the site. Set up a beta based on a content category. The beta can apply to one part of the site. There is a risk that if the project does not achieve a measure of usability, stakeholders may lose interest. The CSS properties project was that set that folks could use as a resource. This calls for focusing on content, to the exclusion of other things.

This should be a fundamental shift in how we do this. Not beta criteria for all of WPD, but define beta criteria for individual content areas, and define beta status on each bucket. Define "beta" as pertaining to discrete content areas. First "beta": CSS Properties.

We need a milestone achievement - CSS Properties. If work doesn't lead to that, defer it. This week, we realized we're spreading our energies too thin. So we should focus our energies on CSS properties project. But, volunteer help is not fungible. For example, Max Polk is willing to work on the MSDN stuff but not interested in other bits. The only thing I would say that needs to be done is:

1) have the compatibility tables from MSDN and caniuse working (because that's a big part of content creation and user experience). If people come to the site and don't see consistent compat tables, it doesn't look good. So our work there is better spent finishing up compat extension.

2) Also, we need to have an exemplar for each page, which is the criteria we had for beta--that's the other thing we we should have for beta.

We all agree on CSS Properties. Other content areas will be deferred.

What about other beta tasks?

Do we want to go back to the project status page and look at those and say if any of those are direct for beta? If we focus on this stuff and don't try to recruit additional contributors, and we say CSS properties are beta, will we have a site that people can consume and contribute to?

Eliot: There are two things there. There's the content effort and the infrastructure effort. (The latter includes compat tables, community, etc.) community growth can still go on, it's separated from what the community is working on. Even MDN is mostly people consuming. Really only about 15 contributors.

Want to reframe a bit: "What is beta" ? what are we trying to accomplish? who is the audience?

1)	ourselves. To push ourselves and feel momentum
2)	an opportunity to talk to, after the alpha announcement, to engage public and say hey look, another chance to introduce ourselves
3)	is the stewards

If we talk about this awesome resource, and we don't have it yet, web developers need to see progress, momentum. if they see value, they'll respond, if devs promote, we're successful. We aren't changing our goals. We need to change focus and messaging for this content only. This was the general plan from the beginning of the CSS properties project?

If we do micro-betas, it may dilute the impact of a general beta. It will be virtually impossible for us to get _all_ of the content to beta.

But if we have a set of clear, well-defined criteria for the different sections, that shows evidence of progress. So it's the only path to success.

Then we need to be clear that we're focused on the _content_, not the _site_. We'll continually revise and refine our processes around recruitment and participation. We've already got a lot more than what we started with. We've made some strides in that area. Some efforts in regard to recruiting may not be timed appropriately to achieve a short-term objective.

When Eliot sent the mail out, he was looking at was our loss of focus on the content front. We're putting together a LARGE project with many different facets. At Microsoft, we have a team of writers, and a production team, and a marketing team 
and we don't take marketing people off that when we need to do a content push.

We shouldn't do it here. We should identify who's working on what, and what they're doing. The note was really just about loss of focus on Content front. We'll continue to look at bugs and project status page focus on other areas, but as far as content effort goes, we focus on CSS properties. Other aspects are secondary but still important.

Folks will review their bugs:

Infrastrucutre is Doug. Content is Scott, Chris, and Julee. Community is Janet for beta criteria.

Right now, the site notice has a new call to action on JS.

===TOPIC: CSS Properties work===

The CSS properties sheet is overwhelming folks. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRs-89PKiZpdE0xdm9Sb1ZvRW1ZRzMtWEdyU0Z4OEE#gid=17 Julee updated it].

==DISCUSSION==

===TOPIC: Appearance of content flags===

Limited, but pointed feedback (from doc sprinters, others) suggests red flags may be a deterrent to editing content. Consider toning them down?

... it's a bit "boy who cried wolf"

Should the meaning of flags be explained more explicitly when being set and viewed?

Some of them should be stronger than others

being able to change the priorities/visibility, and actions that are obvious from them

ideally, stub should be more inviting, for example

Back at the beginning, the plan was to display them differently to signed in vs signed out people

Also, flag banner is broken: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/!DOCTYPE

[agreement that this is something to fix]


For beta, clear visual representation that this page is considered Beta-ready or not, we won't be able to touch all of the pages for beta

That's especially important given that some parts of site will be ready to be called beta before others

Could just have a banner that says "flags associated" or "this article is not beta ready", and when you go down to the _bottom_ it shows the flags

If you look at the compat table's output, when you mouse over it shows one thing for all mobiles; then when you mouse over it shows details

Also, I think a simple tooltip for explanation of flags (on hover) would be sufficient, maybe have popup appear on mobile devices
but something like that that says "there are flags on this page" and when you hover over see the specific ones

vs going to a whole separate page

... also we haven't done a great job of encouraging a culture of using flags

... we need to work those flagged pages back into the work flow

Making each flag a call to action could help

I think a tooltip explanation on the page whee it happens and a longer explanation linked from the editing page, where you set the flags would work

... comments thing was also supposed to help with flagging

... we want the comments thing to plug in to the issue tracker. Ideally the flags would go into the issue tracker

... ideally on the page you check off, I've done this, it hits the API to issue tracker and says "this action ahs been done"


A lot of work, but there could be phases to it. If we can get the current UI to reflect the call to action


and then later on hook up to project tracking


My original ideas was to have them discrete and off to the sdie

... right now they're a banner at the top of most pages


Also, if you could be clear about what the workflow should be

... in other words, contributor goes to edit the page, see one banner, they click on that, then they see all flags as calls to action...


===Topic: DOM API reorganization proposal===

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Projects/DOM_API_docs

Adopted with the following discussion:

Want to make sure it's predictable and avoids conflicts
Follow basic object hierachy but flatten it out

Shepazu provided one example of proper DOM hierarchy:

http://objjob.phrogz.net/

that lets you drill around all around everywhere within the DOM. I had a vision that all of these things would be interlinked

URL schema for DOM API and visual representation of the DOM don't have to be the same thing. There's a lot of depth to the DOM that users don't need exposure to when they're coding. There are two use cases. The one we're solving for primarily is to figure out what a particular method does--they don't care about where it is in the dom tree. But that would address the other use case of exploring

We should have a widget that allows you to explore the particular object and its hierarchy as a UI element as opposed to a URL element

Are these two problems: 1) URL hierarchy 2) rendering of content to readers?


It's about 1200 pages tagged as DOM. And you need to be an admin to do moves


We should have a big push where we move the pages.

Fr0zenice might know if there's an extension


dunno, but the "move only for admins" thing was never really implemented btw

We don't want to lose this idea of a visual representation of the DOM. something we could point to as a differentiator. Because there's no good place to see that today

What we're documenting here is one ideal reference implementation of all the specs and we can show that to you in this visual way

We do want our work on web platform to help people working on standards

Not in URL structure, but in a separate experience

===Topic:  Task force statuses===

====Community Development====

we firmed up out plans for upcoming doc sprints


Any updates to any of the events should be reflected on the [[WPD:Community/Community_Events|events page]].

shepazu's great idea : have a non-political description of DRM and DNT, have technical articles about those and make a blog post.

... the TECHNICAL aspect, not political, social, or standardization aspect

and the ancillary idea was: we have an alpha banner, but we don't have anything about the campaigns we're working on (like CSS properties)

... when we have a push, we should highlight them in the banner

Redesiging the notice so it's not quite so ugly and what our current call to action

So, we have the blog, but do we also need a News or Current Events page linked to from the home page?

More controversial topics might get more vandalism, we'll need to be vigilant.

And we'll want to make it clear we're trying to just be about TECHNICAL aspects.

Have a disclaimer, if you want to discuss social aspects, here are some links for you to go to to do that


the blog entry where we say "we realize these are controversial, this is the role we're trying to play"

===TOPIC: Status of CSS properties project===

We're stalled on contributors to content. Not too much to review compared to content we need to create

We might need to broaden our base to get more contributors

===TOPIC: compatibility tables===
http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Compatibility_Info


There's a disconnect between pages that we have and granularity of caniuse data

If we're going to replace our existing compat tables, we'll need to do so comprehensively.

MOzilla agreed that we can crawl MDN's compat information, as this is public domain content. They agreed that we can use this data, and are not required to mark it as their _license_, although of course we'll say we got the info from them.

Shepazu is working on a script to extract data from them, merge with caniuse

If there's a test missing, then we'll provide a simple interface for folks to provide one, or at least some input.

if you see something missing, if you want to give the test to help with that
it will take them to a thing to let them contribute a test

That's huge overhead, will discourage contributions.

But how will we know it's good if they just make an assertion?


We can have a way to put in unverified information, but it should be tagged that it needs tests

==DISCUSSION==

===TOPIC: CSS Properties reviewers===

Doug and Chris Mills commented. Maybe have design experts join in, but unclear if they were to be SME to review content or the design of the pages.
we did a couple of rounds on the template.

We did another round in January, so I don't think we need to review the design further. Does anyone else?

Lea's been good about finding optimizations and fixing problems.

Joanie Rustalkin who helped design said we could contact her. She'd be an obvious choice.
But let's not revisit design of the template.

The idea was to get feedback on the content. But Lea can review design and discuss with other designers, such as Chris Coyier.

===TOPIC: Compatibility tables===

May be able to pull in data for mobile, too. http://mobilehtml5.org/ http://firt.mobi/about.php

Any others?

http://html5test.com/results/desktop.html
Their methodology did not--ironically-seem test-based. Shepazu to 
contact them anyway.

===TOPIC: TF updates:===

====Community====

had a meeting last week

university outreach: established a spreadsheet. Will list contact there, but we won't make that public.

We will invite people to contribute to that list.
[
We're considering doc sprints. Still working on that.

Established a regular meeting time. Tuesdays at 10am Pacific time.

If we have an agenda, we'll use the time. Otherwise cancel instance.
====Analytics====

Topic clusters.

Setting up a human readable site map.
We'll track campaign and emails.

 Before any doc sprint, need to set up a campaign.

Our SEO: Setting it up. Next step is to optimize the content. We have this tracked in Bug Genie.

==== Program Management====

Meetings 11am Pacific time on Mondays.

Triaging bugs and gathering information about the state of the beta work.

This week we asked people to take ownership of the different project buckets. Owners will define the deliverables and build a time, triaging issues, reporting back to the PM group on progress towards beta.

We also talked about BugGenie and how to get reporting done ACROSS projects.

Hopefully, we can get away from meetings and get a dashboard look at status.

===TOPIC: URL structure DOM, JS, and topic clusters===

URL/structure of DOM API docs.

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Projects/DOM_API_docs

follows the same scheme as API docs, but without the API listing pages that describe the common names. Since the common name for all of these is DOM.

Doesn't affect how we're going to deal with the JS docs from Microsoft.

scottrowe: If folks would review that, it'd be great. I added some more info.

You coulld make a case that everything's in the DOM, but that wouldn't help people delineate anything from DOM down.

We've done that in our top level buckets , and now we're isolating a subgroup of the DOM and calling that the DOM APIs.

.They're the interfaces and objects you use when interfacing with the object model. I can make it clearer in the proposal, but I thought that was an established methodology.

this came up earlier, and I hashed it out with some architects. We couldn't come up with a sensible way of doing an alternate view. Scott's proposal is widely accepted.

We still need to have some kind of instruction--even visual representation--of the DOm, interfaces, JS, etc.
That might be an article, so then we could explain why we put things places.

We haven't talked a lot about interlinking between articles and we should look at that a lot.

We should cross-reference related things. MediaWiki doesn't make it as easy as a dedicated documentation CMS, but.

We'd talked about topic clusters as doing this.

There's an issue filed. Let's use that to discuss this.

There may be a passive-aggressive way to make them enter links: topic cluster UI based on links within doc, so if you don't have links, your topic cluster doesn't look right.

http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/42

===TOPIC: Session Bug===

MIA Close it!

===TOPIC: Watch channel after tweeting===

When you tweet, don't forget to check conversation for follow-up!

===TOPIC: blogging about new SVG articles===

julee: I think Mike Sierra has moved to something else at Adobe. Finished out a bunch of SVG work. HTML5 weekly mentioned the articles.

===TOPIC: table styles===

In some pages, there are tables without a class to target. If I style all tables inside the container, it'll have unforseen effects. 
Regarding the font, I am fine changing it. PErsonally, I think bitter looks better.
Is there an automated way to add a class to tables that don't have one?

A lot of tables were generated by authors and some use the pipe hack, so there are some issues with tables we generated.

===Discussion===

====TOPIC: April 3 Doc Sprint====
It was great. Scott did a blog post about it.
====TOPIC: A lot of meetings next week====
We should confirm that these meetings are productive: resulting in getting work done. If not, we should review.
====TOPIC: Forums dependencies====
====TOPIC: *====
 
We want to [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2013Apr/0121.html close down forums], but we need to get some things done first. See dependencies: 

http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/40

====TOPIC: Translation URL schema==== 
We came close to a decision on the URL schema for other languages:

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/lang/es/Main_Page

But shepazu said we rejected this many times before.

What we have now is almost the worst of both worlds. Bad design by W3C LOC experts, MW's auto URL schema isn't good, 
what we're doing now is bad for SEO.

Shepazu will follow up with Richard Ishida, W3C's internationalization and localization expert

====TOPIC: Session bug is gone again!====

People haven't seen it, but let's give it a little more time to test.
It was a token bug. There's a token that ID's the session, depending on the memcache. It wasn't able to find the session and the session was lost. Ryan removed single-signon, and changed the memcache server.

====TOPIC: CSS Properties project====
Discuss sending out a "call for review". See [
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2013Apr/0148.html thread].

But what's the process? Is Julee the right person to send reviewers to? What does she then do? How do we handle comments, store them, deal with them after we get the review? Seems like we don't have any system. Do we have the list of pages to review?

We're talking about SME, we can just ask them to just to edit the page. We won't track what changes they're making. But, what if the change should be made across more pages? So our pages are consistent in org or style?

Also, do we have a golden standard? If folks want to talk about specific styles, it's in one location: the golden standard.
Is there a WPD voice? We added the golden standard to the top of the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRs-
89PKiZpdE0xdm9Sb1ZvRW1ZRzMtWEdyU0Z4OEE spreadsheet].

Julee will work with SME to decide what pages they're going to review. If it's something global, they need to call that out and we need to fix it across the docs. 

SMEs are looking for whether he doc is technically accurate.
What we're asking them to determine if the article is "technically accurate?" We're not asking them to set the style of content.

So we do need to hand pick some pages to get SME feedback, but once they say a doc is good, that's good enough.

We're going to get different voices in a Wiki. But, maybe less so in reference docs. But the priorities are:

•	quality content
•	then i18l English
•	Then down the line comes the issue of voice.
So, the ref should be in active voice and some other things, but we shouldn't impose too much at the beginning. Not before we see how things evolve.

Let's have as little process as possible. This is our first major writing project, let's put the least process in the beginning and put checkpoints in place later.

We should make it clear that SMEs need to let us know if there's something global.

And the letter needs to say if they see something that should be fixed across pages, or if they see any problems, contact julee. Want to make it easy for the SMEs to give feedback but doesn't need an official process to make that happen.

shepazu: is concerned that we would make a call for review and problems that would cause them not to come back later. this is a push to a larger community than we've had, so we want them to feel satisfied.

Julee will send out an email clarifying process. 

====TOPIC: Project.* project====
Garbee writing instrux. Having a state view of the beta is a dependency on reporting progress. This can be accomplished with a master project bucket.

shepazu: julee & shepazu will follow up

====TOPIC: Global nav project====
The [http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/14 global nav] has not been implemented consistently. Forums closing has a dependencies on this project.

Lea's out this week. She's going to point to WPD in her preso!


====TOPIC: Beginners guide to web dev====

Chris Mills created all of the landing pages and writing updated text for the landing page.

http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/TEST:beginners

http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/41

Note we have commenting on the issue page! Try to move discussion about implementation to project.* page.

====TOPIC: Populating news email list with university====

This is probably a comm & recruiting item. In the meantime, we're asking everyone to please gather university contacts to add to an announce email list.

ALSO: Fellowships, interships, mentoring programs for students: GSoC: we got rejected (explicitly not for documentation). But w3c did get approved. Shepazu will follow up.

Media Wiki has a mentoring program, can we add our project to their list? Julee will follow up.

====TOPIC: status of table styles====

Lea will incorporate scott's feedback.

====TOPIC: W3C WG====

W3C WG  is the week after next, may interfere with this meeting. Eliot and Shepazu will talk about presenting there.

====TOPIC: Compatibility tables project====

Shepazu has been working on extension with caniuse data; alexsis d. & ppk: quirks mode data is all HTML.

PPK will package this data. Shepazu is merging these data sets. We may use MDN data as a fallback for the gaps in the caniuse and quirksmode datasets.

Need to optimize with edge side includes (tell fastly to cache it as a special case) Fastly said we can do this.

Need to work out a process for manual customization? (Maybe just the open text field?)

Shooting for end of April to deploy on all ref pages.

====TOPIC: WPD AS PLUGIN==== 
Tom Ortega wants to participate by investigate building plugins for standard editors: to have WPD be a plugin for these IDE. Julee referred him to frozenice as an initial contact.

===ACTION ITEMS===

* shepazu will call in Richard Ishida, W3C's internationalization and localization expert (DONE)
* Julee to write a draft email outlining the process to use for CSS properties review as instructions for SMEs. (DONE http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/43)

[http://project.webplatform.org/infrastructure/issues/3 Issue #3, update error message] was closed
[http://project.webplatform.org/infrastructure/issues/2 Issue #2, page not refreshing] is not to be confused with [http://project.webplatform.org/infrastructure/issues/1 Issue #1]


Ryan Lane has identified this issue as an edit token issue. Excerpt from IRC of community mtg: 

Ryan_Lane: the memcache configuration we're using now is the new style available in mediawiki since 1.18. It's what's used in production at wikimedia, and it uses the pecl memcache client, rather than mediawiki's home brewed in-php support. 

Ryan_Lane: Are we still using the SSO plugin? And if so, do we still need it? It screws around with what's in memcache 

patrickdsouza: if someone could look into the logs and check julee's logins you could try reproducing the bug. 

julee: If user edits the page for a long time it is more likely to happen. 

Ryan_Lane: Are we still using the SSO plugin? And if so, do we still need it? It screws around with what's in memcache. 

Ryan_Lane: Are people actually logged out, or does it just say "a loss of session data" when trying to save an edit? 

julee: I just got this error: "Oops! We seem to have a conflict. Please try saving again. If it still does not work after 2 or 3 attempts, try logging out and logging back in." I knew I was going to get that error because I had my page open in edit mode for so long 

Ryan_Lane: that's not actually a session issue. That's an edit token issue. I'd need to see where the edit token is stored. I'd imagine memcache, but maybe not. I'm positive this could be fixed by ensuring logged in users always hit the same application server once they are logged in, but that's really just avoiding the real problem 

====TOPIC: 4/3 Doc Sprint====

Peter already has secured facilities and catering. It's at Google's offices in SFL:
* very much like previous doc sprints
* the big ticket item this time is CSS properties project, but other people should suggest other projects
* Scott to run new people through a getting started observe whether the getting started pages/workflow is working for people. 4 or 5 people .
* So many Doc Sprints in the Bay Area. We might really want to try to incorporate remote participation again.
* It starts at 9, but you can come early. I'll be there by 8, 8:30.
* We'll have schwag, a bunch of t-shirts

====TOPIC: Dom API====

A quick huddle to talk about overall site organization and how we want to handle DOM API pages. There are multiple ways to look at DOM. We want to entertain different viewpoints into the model, based on the way people experience it. We're not locked into a single hierarchy because this isn't a book. Only one URL structure, but maybe multiple views?

We may begin talk at Doc Sprint or Content project area lead will set a meeting to discuss.

====TOPIC: Dealing with "issues"====
A bunch of issues are sitting around. Let's get project owners and encourage triage and status on bugs, at the project level. Then these projects roll up in some way in summary.

Minimally, we should get all issues in bug genie assigned (something that bugzilla requires).

====TOPIC: 404 page====

Lea agreed to look into the UX for 404 pages. She will design and will request fine tuning of content. 
http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Projects/ErrorPages

====TOPIC: Code styles====

shepazu hid code markup styling because it were ugly, but leaverou restyled and brought back. She added Prism.js. Before, the code examples had an indication of what language they were in, but the markup wasn't in the format prism expected. So, leaverou wrote some code to transform to the right format, so we now have nicely highlighted ones! It only works on samples with a language set.

====TOPIC: Global navs====

leaverou implemented the bottom global content navs! She is also willing to take up [http://project.webplatform.org/content/issues/14 Issue #14]:

===Discussion===

====TOPIC: CSS Properties====

ACTION: * everyone:

** if you haven't been editing pages, can you volunteer to do a CSS property? that will get you used to editing the wiki and experiencing what our users are experiencing?
** also try to recruit one or two people to do some property pages.
** and if you could help me with the review process. If there are certain pages that should be reviewed by an expert, call them out to me.
** and if you have ideas of experts who would be good reviewers, let me know--we need a significant number of them before we can claim that the docs are good
** Use the new "needs review" tag to tag articles that need review

ACTION: shepazu to reach out to public CSS WG list and ask for experts to review CSS pages

For the beginning, the webkit team will likely just need a stable URL scheme and that's it, so they can generate lists

Eliot said that, unfortunately, someone who was going to join the project won't be able to join due to personal reasons. looking for someone to take his place, but no great options at the moment

====TOPIC: Topic vs Topic Clusters====
scottrowe_ did docs on that. more usable and better-accessed during the getting started flow and editor's guide

====TOPIC: Taxonomy of the site====
We still want to generate a sitemap. Doug and I spoke about this over e-mail to the list. Doug is going to get Julee access so she can experiment with generating a sitemap.

ACTION: Denis to follow up with Julee about sitemap generation [DONE]

scottrowe_ has been looking into the DOM project in relation to the Shadow DOM documentation. He's trying to figure out how we should design our DOM API pages generally. He will propose the DOM project as next quarter's project, just like CSS was this quarter's project.

Let's focus on CSS properties first.

DOM organization & refactoring is a pre-beta criteria. Even if we could just settle how we're going to organize it, then we could have a solid beta presentation.

Coming up with a set of beta guidelines soon. It will include the DOM is part of the architecture of the site is a pre-beta criteria

Segment the site (E.g. css properties) getting to "beta" individually as their quality gets to the right level.

But make it clear what's beta and what isn't. Add visual cues to each section so the solid stuff looks solid, and placeholders look partly there.

And map out what ALL of the pages are and creating stubs. And that goes along with the sitemap that Julee's working on. And helps us not have to explain the new page flow to new contributors – they'll be pre-populated.

This conference is full, no more parties can be added.

ACTION: Shepazu to allocate more spaces in future calls

====TOPIC: URLs for translation====

Some concern over current URL naming schema. We have a page that writes up how to do this. It's not a great process, but it is possible. 

We should do one or more BoF sessions at the html5devcon, to generate buzz, invite folks to grapple with how to handle i18n, catch folks who can't make the sprint, help pack the sprint, etc.

We should address this now if we have volunteers who want to help out. 

ACTION: Shepazu to get richard ishia [sp?] comment on what a better solution will be. He's the W3C l18n expert

The localization guide isn;'t in the editor's guide.

ACTION: shepazu to send localization guide to public lis
ACTION: Julee to call it out to the l18n folks to make sure it makes sense

We will table the long-term solution for now

====TOPIC: Search====

Why we can't fix this part with duplicate results? the default search is bad for mediawiki. We thought we replaced it with Lucene.
With the advanced search you can already include WPD pages

ACTION: Denis and shepazu to talk about improving built-in search. (Did we replace default search with Lucene?) (Lea to shepazu: this might help: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SphinxSearch)

====TOPIC: Session bug status====
Feedback from users: it's still happening.

Denis talked to fastly guys two weeks ago. He said to change something in the config of servers. But it must not have worked.

ACTION: Denis to continue debugging the session bug

====TOPIC: Taskforces====

Do we want to report status here, or just in project.webplatform.org?

We can subscribe to updates from task forces via project.webplatform.org

Also, cover highlights from the task teams in this weekly meeting.

=====SUBTOPIC: Community development task force=====

Not enough data from Feb 23rd DocSprint. Next DocSprint 4/3 around HTML5DevConf. They have on their conference webpage they have a signup for WPD. They have about 35 people signed up through EventBrite for conference website, and we have 70 or so on our site. 

Sync community TF goals with project planning.

ACTION: scottrowe_ to set up meeting about next doc sprint

There are young CS students who are interested in getting involved in community.

We are planning to have doc sprints on the east coast. One in Ohio this summer, and at least 2 doc sprints in NC (one in summer, one in fall) – NYC has been requested.

=====SUBTOPIC: Analytics task force=====

We're having our first meeting this week.

====TOPIC: Content completeness====

Now that we have project.webplatform.org, we'll build it into the workflow.

Promotion: Blog posts for even small new additions are great, but for big milestones, we should have more press outreach

ACTION: julee to follow up with garbee on how to do workflows and forms in BG

We talked yesterday about figuring out fields and milestones. Garbee has promised to document things about BG and has committed to do some videos. We may want to set up another session for other people.

====TOPIC: Any new or notable content to promote?====

Adobe gave us some of Mike Sierra's times. He created several articles, one on transforms that's quite good. He's currently working on SVG
I think that's notable and good to share. We've shared some of it and got a bunch of retweets. We should be more aggressive about tweeting out new batches of articles that we've created.

Also, for the last 6 months we've benefited from the participation of Dave Gash, a contractor at Google, worked on API pages and CSS properties. There are a handful more to do, then we should put together a comm plan for that content.

ACTION: shepazu to invite people to twitter account

Remember it's good to get a quick LGTM from someone in IRC for spelling, links, etc.

ACTION: peterlubbers to invite people to the Google+ admins

Folks are putting bylines on articles. That's appropriate for primary authors. It's a nice incentive.

perhaps we should have a clearer policy around author attribution or have a significant contributions page to highlight contributions? It's capture din MediaWiki, but not highlighted well.

publicity workflow -- it should be easy to rain kudos on a team member when they earn it

mozilla blog they have open badges 1.0 https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/03/14/open_badges/


ACTION: Julee to add comm plan as a topic for the community taskforce.

====TOPIC: Kuma====

Denis has been reviewing Kuma, made a local installation. So far, it's been easy to install. But he needs to figure out if it can be a good fit. Janet sent Denis some contacts, Kuma developers. They've been very helpful. This is background stuff, shouldn't affect any work going on.

** Spec status values should be resolved. Lea brings up a good point: maybe we should be calling it "browser support". [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20386 20386] [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=18896 18896]
* Dealing with browser compat info — it is hard and time consuming; can we automate it? See mail from Doug May: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2013Feb/0002.html. See also: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Compatibility_Info

*** http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/font-size
*** https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20386
*** font-style property page spec status: values are not usable; bug filed; considering different values than those of W3C
*** How to represent feature status so visitor knows whether it's in most browsers? Production-ready?
*** Community does need to know the status so it can participate. Need to bring the community in the standard development process; need to know if a spec is in "last call" or what, so the community can know whether/how to participate.
*** Should we add information about level of usability? Providing both values? Should we move this info to the bottom of the page? Near compatibility? Or should it stay up top for easy identification? Maybe an easy flag up top with details below?
*** html5please.com was offered up as a site that does it well: http://html5please.com/#gradients
** ACTION: JULEE to send out email to public list to get input.
** SUBTOPIC: The dreaded SESSION BUG!!! (Bug#19914). Memcache fix does not appear to solve the problem. It might be cloud infrastructure issue.

===Meeting Summary===

* Several folks weren't available to discuss open issues and action items. 
* We talked about a Table of Contents or nav at the top of articles. There was a TOC in the skin, and also one based on a user preference. They conflicted, so we took it out of the skin but if no users have set the preference to show it, we could bring the skin TOC back. But the default ToC was ever styled since
someone had a plugin they wanted to use.
* We are planning blog posts on Audio API and CSS regions
* Janet is going to FOSDEM. Anyone else?
* CSS properties proposal: about 2/3 thru prioritization of properties. Goal is to finish tomorrow, and work on a "representative" article. Then we need to create an author's guide based on the representative article. The property worked on previously was 'font-size'. Mike Sierra to work on making a "gold standard" example page, that others can use as a model. http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/font-size

* Scott is working on Listing pages (Per Scott's email Thursday, December 20, 2012 11:35 AM; Subject: Re: New topic landing pages installed (was Re: We have a new front page))
* Status on Dabblet?
* Anything blocking you from creating great content?

==Meeting Summary==

===Discussion===

* We're adding an API section to the topic landing pages. We need to include APIs and their icons on those pages. Seb is working on an icon, and Chris will put that in the landing page
* Concept_Listing template is done
* Continuing to work on API area: reorganizing it and following through on previous work we've done. The APIs section is starting to come around, with help from Dave Gash.
* Promoting new or great content. To post about WPD topics, see  http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Marketing/Posting_Guidelines. 
** The process right now is shoot it into the Mailing List, wait a bit, and see if anyone disagrees with it. Doug will set up additional bloggers. This content task force will continue to request suggestions for "Any new and notable content to promote"
* DocSprint Germany: Scott Rowe is probably going.
* We received status on the Dabblet extensions. The consensus on the list was code.webplatform.org. Lea has put the technical things in place in her codebase there's still some work to do to link from. First is a dabbler instance on code.webplatform.org. The second phase is to make it easy to open examples on the site in that instance (a "try now" button). Third phase is actual live code examples in the pages themselves. (possibly) via iframes. (There's actually a phase 4 that allows us to decouple a dependency on github.) We're aiming to have first phase done by next week. And we should have a blog post about it. We also need to get a template made with the form to submit/change code in the forms. Garbee is emailing Tomato this afternoon to see if she would be up for that. 
* We need more work on getting started pages (bug : https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20160). At last doc sprint was they just can't get through them -- somewhere between five and ten people. When we walked them through the basics, they had a hard time getting productive. Following through the instructions is difficult. It should be more self-serve. Julee to send outline of new Editor's Guide next week. Scott to work on usability testing. Also, there are going to be some people who don't respond to the given way. So maybe we have other docs for different mind sets. Scott and Peter are working on Getting Started videos. 
** Additional Getting Started problems: 
*** The form system. For example, we've seen people wanting to use API_Listing template on other pages, which breaks pages (it uses two forms).
*** There was a glitch in the process for updating compatibility tables. A lot of the pages in the "Pages that need compatibility table" weren't working.
*** A lot of people at the Sprint were confused with them. I actually spent most of the day there explaining it to people.
*** A handful actually went to editing source because the button was there. Some of us want to remove that button unless you are an admin or in the template corp group whenever that gets made.
*** Besides forms people were getting hit hard by the template bugs that require the hacks like {{!}} and {{=}}. We need to either fix it so those hacks aren't required or look at another way of doing things.
** Additional solutions:
*** One way to fix the hacks would be editing as much as possible in raw HTML. Leaving mostly only links to be made in the wiki markup.
*** Garbee has an open bug report for it iirc. Has been there for a while. I will bring attention to it once we get an in-house system going.
*** People also seemed to be lost in what was needed to be done. We should try to use the content tracker to a greater extent once we get it in-house.
*** Another way to approach it is that it will always be hard for new editors--so we can also focus on making EXISTING editors more productive and effective.
*** "If you know something that needs to be done but don't have the time, even if it is a 5 minute thing, file a bug report." We should try to encourage that more.
*** We also need better ways for people to get in touch with existing editors if they have questions. Not having a web chat system hurts a bit probably. (We could iframe freenode's webchat today and have a safe system online!)
* Alex gives us a tantalizing tease: join meeting next week for some good news.
* Everyone should feel free to add agenda items for these content meetings.

==Meeting summary==
===Discussion===

* Note that the [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?product=webplatform.org&component=content&resolution=---&list_id=2513 content bugs] are assigned to either Chris or Garbee. We wonder how do we spread these out to others? Maybe a larger issue than with just the content bugs?
* Discussed top-level pages sent out by Chris. We generally thought Chris's [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2012Dec/0172.html proposed pages] were excellent. Eliot volunteered to do an edit pass on the descriptions.
* We discussed the [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2012Dec/0235.html navigation proposals] (and [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2012Dec/0221.html Proposal for updating links on webplatform.org proposal for updating links]) that have been in the email list. We discussed the pros and cons of providing the reader with a choice of content type or topic area, via hover links on the global nav. We would appreciate a mock-up. We are not sure how the different proposals would actually pan out. Jswisher took the action to follow up in the email threads and request the next level of detail.
* We identified four priorities we're working on to make editing the site easier and hope to have this work completed by the new year:
** The global nav/landing pages, discussed above, that Chris Mills is working on
** The [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20160 consolidation of editorial pages] that Garbee is working on
** Updating the Topic Hierarchy and Architecture pages that Julee is working on
** The [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19390 session bug] that shepazu hopes will be resolved this weekend.
* The Content Task Force will not meet for the next two weeks. We will resume again 1/3/2013.

==Meeting summary==
===Topics discussed===
* We discussed the status on the project/program manager for the content tasks. Alex said he realized that the term "project manager" might have caused some confusion and may have implied too big a scope. Really, it's more about someone who just follows through on Action items. We're continuing to discuss this with those who have volunteered for the role.
* We discussed categorizing the features as stable, proprietary, experimental, and so on.We do have a page that calls out the different statuses: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Property:Standardization_Status. We need to further discuss what are the appropriate categories for WPD. The http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Pillars page says that we should aim to be useful documentation for the web as it is, so categories such as "proprietary" are important, because we might document something that's useful but has legal restrictions. If there's something TOTALLY proprietary, we had talked about having that in a special vendor section as well 
* We discussed the example code style bug [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20227|Bug 20227], but decided to table it for a couple of weeks, because Lea's dabbler code highlighting might land next Friday. (Here's what we have so far: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Manual_Of_Style/Sample_best_practices)
* Topic hierarchy page and architecture page is one place where people go to figure out where things go and where they will be. It needs updating. Julee volunteered to do this. We predicted that questions will probably arise from this task.
* We want to ask each week: Anything blocking you from creating great content? This week, it's the session bug. Ryan has installed the newest version of mediawiki. There are a few conflicts, he's working to resolve those before deploying.
* We called out the user experience bugs for this task force to review, especially to confirm designs are discoverable, accessible, and follows content architecture:
** https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20180 (site organization)
** https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20250 (global nav)
** https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=19386 (links from main)
* This brought up another topic:
* Use Meta bugs on bugzilla are big and fuzzy. Plans, proposals, and scratch pad work should be kept as subpages: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Plans. Not in Bugzilla, and not in another site, such as GitHub. They keep the substantive discussion/plans in WPD:Plans/FOO, and then as actionable sub-items pop out, we file them as bugs that the meta bug depends on.
* Garbee mentioned that one of the things with using Bug genie is we can edit comments.  So we could actually use that as our place to put things like my Beginner's Guide outline as a comment, then just edit that comment when we update things.  Further centralizing some creation there if we 1) Go with Bug Genie and 2) decide to use it that way. So an issue is just opened for it to be created, then the outline is one of the comments.
* When new templates appear, such as the listing pages that were sent out for review this week, call it out in terms of content, reviewing it to make sure they make sense from content perspective.
* We talked about the coming DocSprint at Google. Several folks are going. Several suggestions regarding promoting, gathering like-skilled folks together via tweeting and other social channels. Also several folks are going to try to get editors' feedback about their experience of the site.
* We talked about the template corp and giving access to those who want to edit templates. But not on a one-off basis, more like giving group access.

===Decisions===
* Until we have a project management system in place, plans, proposals, and scratch pad work should be kept as subpages: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Plans. Not in Bugzilla, and not in another site, such as GitHub.

===Action items===
* Julee to find out how to add a meeting bot to the Content TF Meeting.
* Julee to file a bug about the design of reference pages with a non-standard standardization status.
* Eliot to update bug 20227 with pointer to the style guide he wrote
* Garbee to send out his awesome task organization plan
* Scott and Peter to explore social media channels about next week's docsprint
Proposed next discussion topics

==Agenda 2012-11-28==
* Roll call
* Triage of new content architecture issues
* Review of open action items
** The [[WPD:New_Page|New_Page]] page is up to date with example text and links
** just like the Getting Started page which has a [[WPD:Getting_Started#Guides_to_creating_pages|section that anticipates additional guides]] with a link to
** the [[WPD:Creating_API_pages|Creating API Pages guide]], where all of the above is captured, if not tamed.
** Action item for Mike and Julee to try out structure resulted in some issues which we'll continue to discuss today. (See Mike's email to public list 2012-11-15 re: creating api pages.)
* Handling specialized API [[WPD:Creating_API_pages|in light of new guidelines]].
** How to represent constants and exceptions on separate pages?
** Should APIs that add members to existing core interfaces be listed separately?
** Where appropriate, note the DOM node used to access each interface object: document, navigator, window, video, audio, etc.
* [[WPD:Task_Roadmap|Task roadmap]] includes content track, prioritizing content issues. (See email re: task roadmap for content, infrastructure and styling tasks from Chris Mills <cmills@opera.com>.)
* [[https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?product=webplatform.org&component=content&resolution=---&list_id=2496|content bugs]]: Content bugs in bugzilla need your input and resolution.

==Meeting summary==

===Topics discussed===

* We asked editors to review, update, address content bugs in the bug base: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?product=webplatform.org&component=content&resolution=---&list_id=2513
* We pointed out the new task roadmap: http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Task_Roadmap, and related email, and asked for comments. It's a high-level view that's very readable. Editing it (e.g.: adding columns) might be a bit tricky.
* We discussed the need for a project management system and a program manager to ensure content tasks are triaged. WPD:Most_Wanted_Tasks isn't working and we need motivational leaders and tools.
* We continued discussion on creating API pages, focusing on exceptions to the guidelines (WPD:Creating_API_pages).
** What to do for API that add members to an existing interface. For example, CSS Regions includes a new member in the Document interface - keep it with the API or the existing interface? Probably in both. But where does canonical page reside?
** What to do with lots of little bits of information, for example SVG attribute values or the HTML type element? For data modeling purposes, it might be best to create separate pages for each and then include them in the main page. What is best for folks importing, managing content? For the end-user?
* We need to change the meeting time.

===Decisions===

* We will use bug base for tracking content areas that need to be created, such as DOM ranges.
* Until project management for whole project is resolved, we will call out high-level direction on WPD:Task_Roadmap and track specific content issues in bug base.
* We will file content bugs on any additional open issues with the API.

===Action items===

* chrismills to set up a Doodle poll for next meeting times.
* garbee to write guidelines on creating content bugs.
* (was julee, is now) Garbee to write down (in bug creation guidelines) what issues go where (Bugzilla vs. WPD:Task_Roadmap, WPD:Most_Wanted_Tasks, Special:WantedPages, WPD:Getting_Started, etc.)
* Alex to write up a description of the project manager's role.
* All: review this summary to ensure accuracy.

===Proposed next discussion topics===

Address any open issues with concepts and tutorials pages.
