** just like the Getting Started page which has a [[WPD:Getting_Started#Guides_to_creating_pages|section that anticipates additional guides]] with a link to
** the [[WPD:Creating_API_pages|Creating API Pages guide]], where all of the above is captured, if not tamed.
** Action item for Mike and Julee to try out structure resulted in some issues which we'll continue to discuss today. (See Mike's email to public list 2012-11-15 re: creating api pages.)
* Handling specialized API [[WPD:Creating_API_pages|in light of new guidelines]].
** How to represent constants and exceptions on separate pages?
** Should APIs that add members to existing core interfaces be listed separately?
** Where appropriate, note the DOM node used to access each interface object: document, navigator, window, video, audio, etc.
