eliot: AmeliaBR: Quick recap of where we're are.

Amelia: Accepted proposal to be leading topic of QASprint/2014-july

... we are not quite at 50% still lots to go

... good progress though

Doug: (mea cupla) had multiple travel and couldn’t do much

... hopefully will do more next week

... and double efforts

... julee said in an email that she also

(Jen chiming-in about being also late)

(There will be at least 3 people in a NewWave)

... maybe we could setup time

ALL: Agreeing to setup work sprint for a few on Thursday Afternoon PT

... subscribers: Julee, Shepazu

Amalia: Or just start working whenever we can and just shout it out on the channel

Dave: (Offered to work on Jen list starting from bottom)

Amelia (resumes): I expect will have reports

... i'm finding that sections i'm going through are mostly not ready. Occasional ones are though.

... lots of little quirky things and guide to those

... sent an email to help on the quirks

... Link is there to help with those quirks http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/2014Jul
/0025.html

... among issues we have multiple templates to address

... if there are other areas to take care, we will have to make another sprint

Jen: Thank you so much Amelia for this project

eliot:   +1

... if we can even get further to remove confusion, let’s remove all TEST: namespace and Meta:... or what 
we can do is to just move them completely out of the main wiki

... maybe we just have this separate wiki but most importantly unclutter the docs

renoirb: Agrees on Jen proposa

shepazu: Maybe we should update/add tasks in the issue tracker for those

Jen: (agrees)

Amelia: Use the system we have and make it in manageable system

... (agrees: Jen, Shepazu, Renoirb, Amelia)

Julee: Maybe we should have some conventions (its a bit confusing)

... maybe we should have some tagging.

... also, maybe we should state the priorities and create issue tracker meetings

shepazu agrees: "We gotta start somewhre" :)

(Julee: Agrees, but there’s a lot and confusing, we still should have this categorization. Then will make 
it clera)

shepazu: a big efforts makes me feel it will make it too big and no progress, lets’ find quick wins.  Do 
you have a proposal for that?

Julee: I'll try to think of something

(oops, forgot that detail)  proposed by Jen: How about create

... a section in the wiki where we document those edge cases in a specific section (maybe at 
[[WPD:Projects/QASprints]])

(resuming to issue tracker)

Amelia: I'm proposing that we make the next big push to clean the issue tracker

Jen: Maybe we just can start using it (in sync to Shepazu's earlier proposal)

... focussing on doing things

shepazu: I think its a good compromise

... we find a way to tag new issues

... and then through meeting update issues about that

... and use the issue tracker during Community meetings and update  

... we should make it more central so we keep it in front of our eyes

... i like to have issues in this instead of email

Jen: i'm looking at it right now

... enjoys this tool it "feels powerful"

... (maybe its overkill)

... maybe we should focus to pick a very basic

... figure a way to make it way more simple

Julee: The problem with a very simple tool creates a "blob"

... if we do not have someone who prioritize the bugs, we do not have a focus to work on them

... maybe we should spend time and remove "bells and whistle"

... to make bug simpler and still function as a priorotizing system is possible. But the main thing is 
that someone have to commit on them

... to keep it updated

Shepazu: What /kind/ of people should we need on such a tag team

Julee: A "project manager", and maybe two more including, at least, one technical person who can validate 
the issue

Agrees: Renoir, Jen, Julee

Julee: Would you like to join us Amelia

... i'm very excited about this

... we should just purge things and make it simple

AmeliaBR:   Pinging Garbee if you're around:  Will you be able to help give people power to 
re-arrange/organize Bug Genie?

AmeliaBR, your account in bug genie

Garbee, no need to update amelia

Also, I updated Eliot as an administrator

shepazu: Just to add another aspect, Amelia correctly diagnosed an issue on the compatibility tables

... renoir sent an email describing the issue and the planned work to resolve the problem
