[13:29:53]  @renoirb:	 renoirb: explaiining why not making it forward
[13:30:05]  @renoirb:	 ... because: my current focus is about single sign on

[13:31:31]  @renoirb:	 ... full time, so until it others priorities are finished
[13:31:40]  @renoirb:	 ... unless it breaks and cannot be fixed
[13:31:49]  @renoirb:	 ... we have a known issue, and how to live with it.
[13:32:00]  @renoirb:	 ... to keep priority on sso, unless it blocks progress

[13:40:37]  AmeliaBR:	 The W3C Blog kind of covers latest news in web standards: http://www.w3.org/blog/
[13:41:23]  @renoirb:	 ... we want to talk about the web standards stuff as a point of view of somebody already knows at least some of the backgrounds
[13:41:30]  @renoirb:	 ... length should not be more than 40 minutes
[13:41:50]  @renoirb:	 ... there could be interviews too
[13:41:54]  @Garbee:	 40 minutes max? Seems a bit tight.
[13:42:03]  @renoirb:	 ... a person, about [a spec] that they’re doing
[13:42:14]  @renoirb:	 ... why should [the listener] care about it
[13:42:20]  @renoirb:	 ... but not competition
[13:43:10]  @renoirb:	 ... a little bit "insider" but not going in back story (maybe pointing to them if listener need)
[13:43:30]  @renoirb:	 ... audience is people who has at least some basic on the standards

[13:47:27]  eliot:	 I just have reservations about Doug's time being spent on this cool and fun project when boring things like content and infrastructure need his attention. Not worried about Bruce or David, and the project sounds cool.
[13:49:52]  @renoirb:	 shepazu:... this project is not about to start before we are done with other priorities
[13:50:32]  @renoirb:	 ... such as: CompaTables, SSO, Flags

[13:57:14]  @renoirb:	 ... we should be able to roll it out, will be a simple box that says the status. Nothing will show up if nothing is set and later CSS will change that later like discussed last week
[13:59:01]  @renoirb:	 AmeliaBR ^
[13:59:47]  @renoirb:	 shepazu: We didn’t got news from Pat Tressel about it, I'm going to get news from both him and frozenice
