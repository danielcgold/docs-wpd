===Agenda===
* May 22nd NYC Doc Sprint has been canceled.
* Tabled items from last week (see below)

===Notes===
Present: shepazu, julee, jswisher, scott_rowe, millo (IRC only)

* Doc sprints
** May 22nd NYC Doc Sprint has been postponed. Patrick is seeking a venue and a date. 
** North Carolina sprint (Doug) is looking unlikely.
** No sprint for Portland/OSCON, as it's mostly ''not'' a webdev conference; but do a WPD Wednesday that week.
** Millo reports he has tentatively scheduled a sprint in Seattle for May 31st, in collaboration with U of Washington.
** Jay Meissner is working on setting up a sprint in Zurich, in conjunction with a conference, August 28th.
** Paul Verbeek (who attended the Berlin sprint) is organizing a sprint in conjunction with Fronteers in Amsterdam in October. Scott hopes to attend.
** ACTION: Scott to update Events page (already DONE)

* University outreach
** Clarify what we're asking academics to do
** So far, just subscribe to a news list.
** Not focusing (yet) on programs or direct recruiting
** Reaching out to Tech Writing depts, like at UWash (not all U's have them)

* Beta community efforts
** WPD Wednesday is to push towards beta content quality
** Reviewing is one of the 5 tasks for WPD Wed, along with writing basic facts, writing explanations, writing examples with explanations, and filling in links to related content.
** The CSS mailing list is a good place to recruit interested, knowledgeable people (not nec. CSS Working Group members, who are already over-burdened)
** Can do a broadcast appeal on the list; better if comes from someone not affiliated with W3C. ACTION: Julee to send message that Doug has drafted.
** Also approach list members 1-to-1: "Your post on X was great! Can you help write/edit/review WPD pages about X?" I.e., specific to that person, and their expertise, in response to something they did, asking for specific action. ACTION: Doug to ask Lea to keep an eye out for candidates; Julee is also on the list and can help.

==Tuesday, April 30, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. PDT / 1:00 p.m. EDT / 5:00 p.m. GMT==

===Agenda===
* Progress on university outreach.
** Spreadsheet created and sent to comm & recruiting TF members.
** We want funding to go to content contributors, per Alex.
* Should we have a launch plan for Beta: who will create & lead it?
* Should we have a "New & Notable" checklist: a mini-launch list for great new content or features. Something like:
** Get a couple of folks to look at it.
** Get a campaign id for piwik.
** Write a blog about it.
** Send it out in social media.
** Ask folks on the public list and IRC to re-tweet or whatever.
** Get stewards to point to it from their highly-juiced pages.
* Doc Sprint North Carolina (?)
* Doc Sprint Zurich, targeted for August 28: Call for Experts, who can support the event on-site?
* NYC Doc Sprint update
** Patrick D'Souza working with venues to host the event before he starts promoting the event http://wpd-nyc.eventbrite.com/
** One of the organizers of Patrick's meetup has backed out because of some personal reasons so he's working with another organizer Matt Mapplebeck to identify venues and promote it. Working with About.com to get them to host the event (tentative). Emails have been sent out to other potential venues and meetup organizers and I'm waiting for their response this week
** Appnexus is unable to host the event as they are hosting some other events during that week.

Anyway, what I want to ask is relative to the previous question about goals.  In reaching out to universities, are we looking for collaborators or to make people aware of our docs as a source for developing best practices?  In other words should people already be looking here as this being a com
10:21 AM <David_Herz> resource.  If so, why start so late (i.e. university)?  My kids, starting at 9 years old, are going to eCamp this summer.

10:01 AM <scottrowe_> Community Development Task Force Meeting Starting Now
10:05 AM → jswisher joined (~jswisher@cpe-173-174-46-161.austin.res.rr.com)
10:05 AM <jswisher> TOPIC: Doc sprints
10:06 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: patrickdsouza is planning a doc sprint in NYC for 3rd week in May
10:06 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: what do you need to organize a doc sprint?
10:06 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: a place, food, etc.; maybe get local sponsors
10:07 AM <scottrowe_> https://www.internetweekny.com/
10:08 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: also need a targeted promotion campaign
10:08 AM <jswisher> … if the audience is too general, not good
10:08 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: I have access to about 3000 JS devs through meetup
10:08 AM <jswisher> … what i need is someone with experience with doc sprints
10:09 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: I might be able to make that, depending on the date
10:09 AM <jswisher> … Thursday is better than Friday, which is right before Memorial Day weekend
10:10 AM <jswisher> … Probably not good to do multiple days, in conjunction with Internet Week
10:10 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Should have a focus for the sprint, probably MS's JS docs
10:11 AM <jswisher> … This should be an easy way to start participating, reviewing the imported docs
10:12 AM <jswisher> … Might be nice to have a per-page script to check for issues, or a checklist
10:14 AM <jswisher> … Need to find someone who is strong with JS to lead the sprint
10:14 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Need to define a process for people to follow, step by step
10:14 AM <jswisher> … Need someone to draw up the process, test it, etc. before the sprint
10:16 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Maybe get John Resig involved?
10:16 AM <jswisher> … I'll see if he could do a keynote or something
10:17 AM <jswisher> jswisher: We should get someone who has experience with the WPD site
10:17 AM <jswisher> shepazu: I'm familiar with WPD and JS, and I'll be there
10:17 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Might actually be a good idea to do multiple days
10:18 AM <jswisher> … There are a lot of other things going on that week, and that would give people more options of when to come
10:18 AM <jswisher> … Need to get the event onto the internet week event page
10:18 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: I can do that
10:19 AM <jswisher> shepazu: It's only a month out, so need to start planning social media campaign now
10:20 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: How about Wednesday and Thursday?
10:20 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: I can make it for that
10:21 AM <jswisher> TOPIC: Other doc sprints
10:22 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Dates for NYC sprint are May 22 and 23
10:22 AM <jswisher> shepazu: I should be able to make that
10:23 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Sprint at OSCON in Portland OR in July?
10:23 AM <jswisher> shepazu: I talked to someone from OSCON
10:24 AM <jswisher> … had a call last week, about WPD and W3Conf
10:25 AM <jswisher> … They are going to get back with me next week
10:25 AM <jswisher> … We may be able to get venue space from them
10:26 AM <jswisher> … In any case, we can find some venue in portland
10:28 AM <scottrowe_> http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013
10:31 AM <patrickdsouza> i need to peel off the call. i'm available on irc.
10:31 AM <patrickdsouza> yes wednesday and thursday. i'll work on the venues.
10:34 AM <jswisher> http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/
10:37 AM <jswisher> jswisher: I'll be in Portland that whole week, so maybe something Monday and Tuesday of that week
10:37 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Peter and I want to do a doc sprint in NYC on September 13
10:38 AM <jswisher> … To do thru Google, just have to fill out a form, and boom, instant doc sprint
10:38 AM <jswisher> … Not too close in time to Amsterdam sprint
10:39 AM <jswisher> … Amsterdam sprint is rolling along
10:40 AM <scottrowe_> http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Meetings/Community_Development
10:41 AM <jswisher> TOPIC: Doug's great idea
10:42 AM <jswisher> shepazu: patrickdsouza was talking about "evergreen" content vs. "seasonal" content
10:42 AM <patrickdsouza> yes
10:42 AM <jswisher> shepazu: e.g., evergreen is stuff that people will always be looking for, e.g., CSS properties
10:43 AM <patrickdsouza> seasonal is like the pointer event
10:43 AM <patrickdsouza> or do not track
10:43 AM <jswisher> seasonal is news-related or time-based
10:44 AM <jswisher> shepazu: It doesn't make sense to buy ads for evergreen content, should do it for a seasonal campaign
10:44 AM <jswisher> … led me to think about what seasonal content we have
10:44 AM <jswisher> … currently, DRM and Do Not Track
10:45 AM <patrickdsouza> http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/183963/ftc-defends-w3cs-do-not-track-initiative-to-congr.html#axzz2RJGLdvCH
10:45 AM <patrickdsouza> ftc
10:45 AM <jswisher> … Feds are telling ad companies to work with W3C if they don't want external regulation
10:46 AM <jswisher> … Could have blog posts about technical aspects of these topics
10:47 AM <jswisher> … could drive traffic from hacker news, reddit, etc.
10:47 AM <jswisher> … We have our alpha disclaimer, but we don't have a notice about our current push
10:48 AM <jswisher> … Let's find a controversial thing to bring people to the site, and then they'll see other things we're working on
10:49 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: sounds great, but how do you know when something is going to be in the news, and be prepared?
10:50 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Like what we did for pointer events, had presentations, wrote docs, coordinated with Last Call for the spec, did a blog post
10:50 AM <jswisher> … won't always be feasible
10:50 AM <jswisher> … Should always have our current push in the banner
10:51 AM <jswisher> … things like DRM and DNT, have been bubbling for a couple of years
10:52 AM <jswisher> … W3C comms team is plugged into things that may come to the fore
10:52 AM <jswisher> … Stewards may also have info about upcoming news
10:52 AM → Ryan_Lane joined (~Ryan_Lane@wikimedia/Ryan-lane)
10:53 AM <jswisher> … We should have evergreen content ready to go, then do a blog post when there's a news cycle about it
10:54 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: some things like WebRTC are both new and exciting, and very slow moving
10:56 AM <jswisher> shepazu: we can't always know, but if we know about something in advance, we should work on making sure we have docs for that
10:58 AM <jswisher> jswisher: We should look for ways to measure the effectiveness of different news cycles at bringing in contributors
10:58 AM <patrickdsouza> we can judge the effectiveness by using tracking campaigns
10:58 AM <scottrowe_> jswisher: need to establish success metrics around recruiting
11:03 AM <patrickdsouza> we definitely need to add tracking ids before a campaign to identify the success of a campaign(doc sprints or social media campaigns). number of comments and discussions around it and improvement in search engine rankings.
11:03 AM <patrickdsouza> and new v/s returning users.
11:04 AM <patrickdsouza> we can discuss this at the analytics task force meeting.
