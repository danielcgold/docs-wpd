* Establish an irregular meeting time (lack of agenda cancels)
* Communications Plan -- Julee to add item (much already listed below falls under this, so the overarching topic has been inserted above)
* Doc Sprint - San Francisco, April 3
** Our immediate opportunity to shape the conversation, and make major progress
** CSS Properties project
*** Review/confront current status and definition of done
*** Create and communicate a compelling vision of what it will mean to us as an industry and as an entrepreneurial community to have this as a resource
*** Identify what it will take to get from here to promotably complete and usable
**** Magnitude of the task(s) by area
**** Design and roll out formal review and vetting
**** Scale up examples and testing as needed to make it whole
**** Key participants and roles needed to drive quality and social validation
**** Promotional campaign (say it, do it, dance!)
**** Be the game changer we have been nominated as
** Getting Started user experience design and usability
*** Easy self-identification by skill, focus, stack level
*** Clear instructions to get set up and get started
*** Clear lists to pull from for the well-established roles and tasks
*** Clear and constructive place to go if you're not clear on what to do
*** Pick short-term (event-centric?) areas of focus to upgrade the overall system
**** hint -- CSS properties completion and community review flow
*** Simple metrics, gamification, promotion, results capture
*** Open ears -- explicitly operate in learning mode; elicit feedback and overtly use it
** Survey
*** Single instrument at checkin to orient new users, remove initial roadblocks, guide them in getting started, and collect feedback in the process (how long does wifi plus registration, IRC/dashboard connect, self-identification, and initial task training take?)
*** Open-ended follow-up to gather stats but more importantly to hear what they have to say (what's in your way of making a bit of a difference on this every week?)
** Getting to steady state ("completion"}
*** What is our overall definition of done?
*** How much community participation will it take?
*** What infrastructure will be needed to enable that?
*** After ramp-up, what will it take ongoingly to maintain our status as the de-facto standard and go-to reference?
** Site architecture (especially the DOM apis)
** Dashboard
*** Start to invest in the perception of continuity and sustainability of both the effort and the results
** Tech talks?
*** Compete with Html5DevConf training day
*** Snag experts while they're in town
*** Exploit the fact that we already have great people, a great venue, and great food, and get some great learning done, in addition to some great work (embellish the fundamental service effort with some topnotch education and exchange of ideas -- the topics don't have to be dead center on the project, but bonus points for any who pull that off, too)
*** Special task team end-of-day debriefs and reports (here's the site design upgrade from this sprint; here's what we did to flesh out the content review process)
** Other items?
** Remote participation (IRC luv)
* Encouraging new webdevs to contribute
