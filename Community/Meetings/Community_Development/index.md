10:05 AM → jswisher joined (~jswisher@cpe-173-174-46-161.austin.res.rr.com)
10:05 AM <jswisher> TOPIC: Doc sprints
10:06 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: patrickdsouza is planning a doc sprint in NYC for 3rd week in May
10:06 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: what do you need to organize a doc sprint?
10:06 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: a place, food, etc.; maybe get local sponsors
10:07 AM <scottrowe_> https://www.internetweekny.com/
10:08 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: also need a targeted promotion campaign
10:08 AM <jswisher> … if the audience is too general, not good
10:08 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: I have access to about 3000 JS devs through meetup
10:08 AM <jswisher> … what i need is someone with experience with doc sprints
10:09 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: I might be able to make that, depending on the date
10:09 AM <jswisher> … Thursday is better than Friday, which is right before Memorial Day weekend
10:10 AM <jswisher> … Probably not good to do multiple days, in conjunction with Internet Week
10:10 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Should have a focus for the sprint, probably MS's JS docs
10:11 AM <jswisher> … This should be an easy way to start participating, reviewing the imported docs
10:12 AM <jswisher> … Might be nice to have a per-page script to check for issues, or a checklist
10:14 AM <jswisher> … Need to find someone who is strong with JS to lead the sprint
10:14 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Need to define a process for people to follow, step by step
10:14 AM <jswisher> … Need someone to draw up the process, test it, etc. before the sprint
10:16 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Maybe get John Resig involved?
10:16 AM <jswisher> … I'll see if he could do a keynote or something
10:17 AM <jswisher> jswisher: We should get someone who has experience with the WPD site
10:17 AM <jswisher> shepazu: I'm familiar with WPD and JS, and I'll be there
10:17 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Might actually be a good idea to do multiple days
10:18 AM <jswisher> … There are a lot of other things going on that week, and that would give people more options of when to come
10:18 AM <jswisher> … Need to get the event onto the internet week event page
10:18 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: I can do that
10:19 AM <jswisher> shepazu: It's only a month out, so need to start planning social media campaign now
10:20 AM <jswisher> patrickdsouza: How about Wednesday and Thursday?
10:20 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: I can make it for that

10:23 AM <jswisher> shepazu: I talked to someone from OSCON
10:24 AM <jswisher> … had a call last week, about WPD and W3Conf
10:25 AM <jswisher> … They are going to get back with me next week
10:25 AM <jswisher> … We may be able to get venue space from them
10:26 AM <jswisher> … In any case, we can find some venue in portland
10:28 AM <scottrowe_> http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013
10:31 AM <patrickdsouza> i need to peel off the call. i'm available on irc.
10:31 AM <patrickdsouza> yes wednesday and thursday. i'll work on the venues.
10:34 AM <jswisher> http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/
10:37 AM <jswisher> jswisher: I'll be in Portland that whole week, so maybe something Monday and Tuesday of that week
10:37 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: Peter and I want to do a doc sprint in NYC on September 13
10:38 AM <jswisher> … To do thru Google, just have to fill out a form, and boom, instant doc sprint
10:38 AM <jswisher> … Not too close in time to Amsterdam sprint
10:39 AM <jswisher> … Amsterdam sprint is rolling along
10:40 AM <scottrowe_> http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Meetings/Community_Development
10:41 AM <jswisher> TOPIC: Doug's great idea
10:42 AM <jswisher> shepazu: patrickdsouza was talking about "evergreen" content vs. "seasonal" content
10:42 AM <patrickdsouza> yes
10:42 AM <jswisher> shepazu: e.g., evergreen is stuff that people will always be looking for, e.g., CSS properties
10:43 AM <patrickdsouza> seasonal is like the pointer event
10:43 AM <patrickdsouza> or do not track
10:43 AM <jswisher> seasonal is news-related or time-based
10:44 AM <jswisher> shepazu: It doesn't make sense to buy ads for evergreen content, should do it for a seasonal campaign
10:44 AM <jswisher> … led me to think about what seasonal content we have
10:44 AM <jswisher> … currently, DRM and Do Not Track
10:45 AM <patrickdsouza> http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/183963/ftc-defends-w3cs-do-not-track-initiative-to-congr.html#axzz2RJGLdvCH
10:45 AM <patrickdsouza> ftc
10:45 AM <jswisher> … Feds are telling ad companies to work with W3C if they don't want external regulation
10:46 AM <jswisher> … Could have blog posts about technical aspects of these topics
10:47 AM <jswisher> … could drive traffic from hacker news, reddit, etc.
10:47 AM <jswisher> … We have our alpha disclaimer, but we don't have a notice about our current push
10:48 AM <jswisher> … Let's find a controversial thing to bring people to the site, and then they'll see other things we're working on
10:49 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: sounds great, but how do you know when something is going to be in the news, and be prepared?
10:50 AM <jswisher> shepazu: Like what we did for pointer events, had presentations, wrote docs, coordinated with Last Call for the spec, did a blog post
10:50 AM <jswisher> … won't always be feasible
10:50 AM <jswisher> … Should always have our current push in the banner
10:51 AM <jswisher> … things like DRM and DNT, have been bubbling for a couple of years
10:52 AM <jswisher> … W3C comms team is plugged into things that may come to the fore
10:52 AM <jswisher> … Stewards may also have info about upcoming news
10:52 AM → Ryan_Lane joined (~Ryan_Lane@wikimedia/Ryan-lane)
10:53 AM <jswisher> … We should have evergreen content ready to go, then do a blog post when there's a news cycle about it
10:54 AM <jswisher> scottrowe_: some things like WebRTC are both new and exciting, and very slow moving
10:56 AM <jswisher> shepazu: we can't always know, but if we know about something in advance, we should work on making sure we have docs for that
10:58 AM <jswisher> jswisher: We should look for ways to measure the effectiveness of different news cycles at bringing in contributors
10:58 AM <patrickdsouza> we can judge the effectiveness by using tracking campaigns
10:58 AM <scottrowe_> jswisher: need to establish success metrics around recruiting
11:03 AM <patrickdsouza> we definitely need to add tracking ids before a campaign to identify the success of a campaign(doc sprints or social media campaigns). number of comments and discussions around it and improvement in search engine rankings.
11:03 AM <patrickdsouza> and new v/s returning users.
11:04 AM <patrickdsouza> we can discuss this at the analytics task force meeting.
