We recommend that you follow both the audio conference and the IRC chat. For those without an audio connection, key updates are provided live on the IRC, courtesy of each week's volunteer scribe.

If you use Skype, regular call-out rates apply. It's only free-of-charge when a teleconference number itself was a North America toll-free number. However, you can call for free with a VOIP service that supports the SIP protocol. The following page has a list of free VOIP services: <http://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/Zakim-SIP>
