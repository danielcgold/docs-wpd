{{Summary_Section|Folowing on from our ideas about [[WPD:Community/Contributor_Recognition|contributor recognition]], we should also run a system whereby experts in different skills should act as mentors for those who want to learn. }}
{{Basic Page}}
This is especially relevant to WPD specific skills like editing and template modification, but could perhaps be extended to other things. The idea would be that the mentor could train the apprentice in that specific skill, and then once the mentor is satisfied that the apprentice has reached a certain level of proficiency, award them a skill badge to say so.
