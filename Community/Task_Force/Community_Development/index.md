<p>Points raised in this section need to be edited and incorporated into the above heading topics or have headings created for them.
</p>
<ul><li> Communications Plan -- Julee to add item (much already listed below falls under this, so the overarching topic has been inserted above)
<ul><li> Our immediate opportunity to shape the conversation, and make major progress</li>
<li> CSS Properties project
<ul><li> Review/confront current status and definition of done</li>
<li> Create and communicate a compelling vision of what it will mean to us as an industry and as an entrepreneurial community to have this as a resource</li>
<li> Identify what it will take to get from here to promotably complete and usable
<ul><li> Magnitude of the task(s) by area</li>
<li> Design and roll out formal review and vetting</li>
<li> Scale up examples and testing as needed to make it whole</li>
<li> Key participants and roles needed to drive quality and social validation</li>
<li> Promotional campaign (say it, do it, dance!)</li>
<li> Be the game changer we have been nominated as</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li> Getting Started user experience design and usability
<ul><li> Easy self-identification by skill, focus, stack level</li>

<li> Clear and constructive place to go if you're not clear on what to do</li>
<li> Pick short-term (event-centric?) areas of focus to upgrade the overall system
<ul><li> hint -- CSS properties completion and community review flow</li></ul></li>
<li> Simple metrics, gamification, promotion, results capture</li>
<li> Open ears -- explicitly operate in learning mode; elicit feedback and overtly use it</li></ul></li>
<li> Survey
<ul><li> Single instrument at checkin to orient new users, remove initial roadblocks, guide them in getting started, and collect feedback in the process (how long does wifi plus registration, IRC/dashboard connect, self-identification, and initial task training take?)</li>
<li> Open-ended follow-up to gather stats but more importantly to hear what they have to say (what's in your way of making a bit of a difference on this every week?)</li></ul></li>
<li> Getting to steady state ("completion"}
<ul><li> What is our overall definition of done?</li>
<li> How much community participation will it take?</li>
<li> What infrastructure will be needed to enable that?</li>
<li> After ramp-up, what will it take ongoingly to maintain our status as the de-facto standard and go-to reference?</li></ul></li>
<li> Site architecture (especially the DOM apis)</li>
<li> Dashboard
<ul><li> Start to invest in the perception of continuity and sustainability of both the effort and the results</li></ul></li>
<li> Tech talks?
<ul><li> Compete with Html5DevConf training day</li>
<li> Snag experts while they're in town</li>
<li> Exploit the fact that we already have great people, a great venue, and great food, and get some great learning done, in addition to some great work (embellish the fundamental service effort with some topnotch education and exchange of ideas -- the topics don't have to be dead center on the project, but bonus points for any who pull that off, too)</li>
<li> Special task team end-of-day debriefs and reports (here's the site design upgrade from this sprint; here's what we did to flesh out the content review process)</li></ul></li>
