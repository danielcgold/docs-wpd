This group will determine the metrics for reporting the success of site visits. At a high level, we're tracking things like:

* Are people visiting?
* Is it site meeting visitor needs
** is content discoverable?
** is content optimized?
* Are people contributing?
* What feedback are they giving us?
* How is social media campaign impacting visits and contributions?
