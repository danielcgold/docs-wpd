This group will determine the metrics for reporting the success of site visits. At a high level, we're tracking things like:

-   Are people visiting?
-   Is it site meeting visitor needs
    -   is content discoverable?
    -   is content optimized?
-   Are people contributing?
-   What feedback are they giving us?
-   How is social media campaign impacting visits and contributions?
