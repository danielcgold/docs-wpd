uri: 'WPD:Community/Survey/Verbatims'

The table below lists the raw comments from participants at the Berlin (Feb. 8 & 9) and San Francisco (Feb. 23) doc sprints, and tracks the bugs logged against these issues. The gathering of this information, along with the [survey](/WPD:Community/Survey) was the first effort toward gaining insight into the usability of the wiki for contributors. Herein are summarized the findings with a bias toward raising issues with respect to editing and contributing.

## <span>Summary</span>

The verbatim information below is summarized here by category. Not all categories are summarized.

### <span>Design/Layout</span>

-   Broken, unimplemented features (Comments, Q&A) are confusing users.
-   Users are unable to log in because the log-in elements do not appear on the home page.

### <span>Editing tasks</span>

-   Editing in MediaWiki and with SMW forms is not easy (this runs contrary to one of our basic assumptions)
-   Session bugs are a serious impediment to productivity.
-   Need a guide to creating examples.
-   Need a process (and a flag) for reviewing contributions.
-   Topics and topic clusters are confusing and rife with abuse.
-   How to documentation (WPD:\*) is hard to find and difficult to follow.
-   Markdown is preferred over MediaWiki markup.
-   Flag design is scaring some users away from working on pages.

### <span>Forms</span>

-   Syntax section too restrictive, not applicable to all cases.
-   (Many other issues, see below.)

### <span>Getting Started</span>

-   Need to identify tasks according to role, domain expertise, skill.
-   Need tasks for designers, and others.
-   Supplement the Getting Started pages with video.
-   Need a more obvious path to getting started from home pages.

### <span>Search</span>

-   Duplicate pages in search results - one for each instance of the search term (this is low-hanging; why is it still on the tree?)
-   Can't search internal help pages.

## <span>Next steps</span>

To help with the resolutions to these problems, in the list below cite the relevant bug from our project management system. If the issue requires a new bug, please create it.
