| class="s3" dir="ltr" | "Block of editorial notes" styling needs improvement - it currently just appears at the top of the page like normal text. This styling is terrible. Surely this should be put in a different style that makes it look obvious that it is not part of the article â€¦ or hidden behind a open/close box, or something. Maybe even put it on the discussion page? Get those back up and working?

| class="s3" dir="ltr" | The "syntax" on the CSS properties template (and probably others too) is not strictly speaking syntax, it is more usage or examples. Syntax implies proper syntax notation like you'd see in the specs. Should we show both? Should we change the labelling of the current "syntax" to something else?
