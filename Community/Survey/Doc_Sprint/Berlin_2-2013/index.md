====In your own words about working with the community====
* Define User Experience as an evaluable process and spread the concept of UX into the world of web development.
* I think there is real need for a good documentation! I'm so tired of looking and reading that takes longer than coding and enjoying the work. Also, if I think about the editors of the future which could get semantic information about the language you're coding (think of autocompletion tuned up), is really exciting, isn't it?
