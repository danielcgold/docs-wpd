==Surveys==

We regularly poll our contributors and users to learn how we can improve the site, the doc sprints, and anything else the community needs us to improve.

Below are the surveys and responses we've received.

===Doc sprint surveys===

These surveys are designed to learn how to improve the doc sprints.

===General surveys===

These are surveys that we run independently of doc sprints. Some never close.

We also track raw comments from various sources [[WPD:Community/Survey/Verbatims|here]].
