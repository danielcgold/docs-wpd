===Comments on the "Goals for content" section of the [[Project_Status]] page==

It should be '''reasonably accurate''', with systems and standards being defined to establish it as a reliable and reusable reference for the community:
* There must be a consensus definition of a '''reference-able''' level of quality, probably with a minimum of two positive SME reviews on top of accurate syntax and a working example, and infrastructure to facilitate the flows, reporting, and completion on all incremental work and relevant feedback, and visually reflect the exact status on all elements.
* There must be a reusable and reference-able listing of the complete topic tree to be included in the reference-able site, with basic status and content reporting via API.
* At least 90% of all identified topics are validated to our standard of '''reference-able'''; all remaining topics are present, syntax-complete to the extent possible, with the rest of their status and open items clearly shown on those pages.

Strategic and tactical suggestions:
* These criteria can be applied to one major content area at a time, so that they enter our expanding Beta stage sequentially.  We can selectively swarm on areas to get them over the line, and apply the incremental lessons learned to the next round. 
* Prioritization of areas to complete should also account for community readiness to both engage in validation (as per our working definition of '''reference-able'''), and in reuse (i.e., consume the API or use the site), for the content.
* We don't expect all APIs and all reuse to be the same.  This may be a secondary consideration in sequencing the topic areas (maybe start with what is better defined, or simpler, or preferably both).
