The Web Platform Docs project is currently in '''Alpha''' phase.

The goal is to get to '''Beta''' phase in a few months.

==What is Beta?==
 
'''Vision:''' The site must perform well, content reasonably good, search working
 
All items need to be moved to Bug Genie. There will be a master project with child projects (sub-projects or components) for each activity. Each project  will itself have sub-projects, with delineated milestones (though particular items may move from one milestones to another). '''Julie will work with Garbee on this'''

Our Beta criteria will have 3 major areas of focus:
* Infrastructure
* Content
* Community
 
Sample Goals:
* All tier 1 content is x% signed off
** We determine the following projects (or pages) are tier 1
* What tutorials pages, too
* Pick milestones by attacks of opportunity
** CSS properties, say, is good
** But we may pick other topics as well
*** SVG for SEO gains, say
* Our goals should play to our strategic needs (SEO, etc., as well as content completeness)
 
==Beta Goals==
