==Work Items==
===Phase 1===
* Bring up an initial version of MediaWiki on our hosting service that makes best available use of the resources available
* Lock down the initial version of the site so only whitelisted users can access before it launches
* Set up an account system that has normal users and administrators
* Set up webplatform.org to point to the wiki
* Get the MediaWiki configured to work with the CDN (e.g. Fastly), including sending site availability notices to team members
* Set up the ~10 Semantic MediaWiki forms for different types of article content (e.g. CSS Reference, Tutorial, User page, etc.)

===Phase 2===
* Implement a theme design in MediaWiki based on provided designs, and iterate on the implementation and design in response to feedback from the committee.
* Import ~3,000 documents from their existing, disparate sources into as consistent a format as reasonably possible
* Teach the committee members how to create their own Semantic MediaWiki forms
* Advise on best practices for running and configuring a wiki running on Semantic MediaWiki
* Ensure that only administrators can create costly Semantic MediaWiki queries
* Various other required minor tasks leading up to the launch that may arise
