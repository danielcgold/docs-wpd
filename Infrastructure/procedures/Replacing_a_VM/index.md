= Replacing a VM =

This document will describe how you can replace any VM in an existing deployment (e.g. production) with a new one.

This kind of action is most useful when we feel a VM has been compromised, or broken. Every VM, including the salt master, is designed to be replaceable parts of a cluster.

The following will show you how to get details on a VM we want to replace, make a new VM, and replace the old with the new one we just created.
