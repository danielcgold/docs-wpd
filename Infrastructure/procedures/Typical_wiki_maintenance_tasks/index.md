{{Basic Page}}
==Migrating a non-form-based page to use the proper form==

On Webplatform.org, all standard pages should be based on the correct form, but you may come across a page that has been created without using the correct section of [[WPD:New_Page]]. If you do come across such a page, you should follow these simple steps to fix it.

# Save the content of the non-form-based page somewhere handy on your local machine
# Find a page with the same page type that you want to convert the non-form-based page to. This should be pretty simple - you can find the URL schema from [[WPD:New_Page]] and then use that to browse to an appropriate page. If you find this ineffective, send a mail around the public mailing list asking for assistance, and someone else will be glad to assist you.
# Select "Edit source" on this page, then copy the entire contents over to the content of the non-form-based page.
# Save the page â€” this should convert it to being a form-based page.
# Select "Edit" on this page, and you should now be able to use the form to edit the content on the previously-non-form-based page!
# Copy your original content into the appropriate form fields.
