<p>This page contains some quick guides to performing small maintenance tasks, which we thought were too small to put on their own separate pages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Migrating_a_non-form-based_page_to_use_the_proper_form">Migrating a non-form-based page to use the proper form</span></h2>
<p>On Webplatform.org, all standard pages should be based on the correct form, but you may come across a page that has been created without using the correct section of <a href="/wiki/WPD:New_Page" title="WPD:New Page">WPD:New_Page</a>. If you do come across such a page, you should follow these simple steps to fix it.
</p>
<ol><li> Save the content of the non-form-based page somewhere handy on your local machine</li>
<li> Find a page with the same page type that you want to convert the non-form-based page to. This should be pretty simple - you can find the URL schema from <a href="/wiki/WPD:New_Page" title="WPD:New Page">WPD:New_Page</a> and then use that to browse to an appropriate page. If you find this ineffective, send a mail around the public mailing list asking for assistance, and someone else will be glad to assist you.</li>
<li> Select "Edit source" on this page, then copy the entire contents over to the content of the non-form-based page.</li>
<li> Save the page — this should convert it to being a form-based page.</li>
<li> Select "Edit" on this page, and you should now be able to use the form to edit the content on the previously-non-form-based page!</li>
<li> Copy your original content into the appropriate form fields.</li></ol>
