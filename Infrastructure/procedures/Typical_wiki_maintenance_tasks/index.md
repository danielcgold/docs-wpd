## <span>Summary</span>

This page contains some quick guides to performing small maintenance tasks, which we thought were too small to put on their own separate pages.

## <span>Migrating a non-form-based page to use the proper form</span>

On Webplatform.org, all standard pages should be based on the correct form, but you may come across a page that has been created without using the correct section of [WPD:New\_Page](/WPD:New_Page). If you do come across such a page, you should follow these simple steps to fix it.

1.  Save the content of the non-form-based page somewhere handy on your local machine
2.  Find a page with the same page type that you want to convert the non-form-based page to. This should be pretty simple - you can find the URL schema from [WPD:New\_Page](/WPD:New_Page) and then use that to browse to an appropriate page. If you find this ineffective, send a mail around the public mailing list asking for assistance, and someone else will be glad to assist you.
3.  Select "Edit source" on this page, then copy the entire contents over to the content of the non-form-based page.
4.  Save the page â€” this should convert it to being a form-based page.
5.  Select "Edit" on this page, and you should now be able to use the form to edit the content on the previously-non-form-based page!
6.  Copy your original content into the appropriate form fields.
