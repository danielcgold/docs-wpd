Here are a few commands we can do to check whatâ€™s happening in the accounts system

## <span>Database queries</span>

### <span>Is a user activated?</span>

     SELECT HEX(uid),HEX(emailCode),email,fullName FROM accounts WHERE emailVerified = 0 AND email LIKE '%@w3.org%';

### <span>Force activation</span>

This can be done by going to a specific link;

     SELECT CONCAT('https://accounts.webplatform.org/verify_email?uid=', HEX(uid), '&code=',HEX(emailCode)) FROM accounts WHERE  emailVerified = 0 AND email LIKE '%@w3.org%';
