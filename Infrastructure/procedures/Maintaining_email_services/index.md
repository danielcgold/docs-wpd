= Maintaining email services =

Every VM relies on a node to send email for them. The node whoâ€™s sole responsibility is to relay emails has "email" in its name, you can read more about that in [[WPD:Infrastructure/architecture/VM_roles#mail|the ''Infrastructure/architecture'' section about the '''"mail" VM role''']].

We are using two email servers:
; Exim: On every VMs, except the ''mail'' node
; Postfix; '''Only''' on the ''mail'' node
