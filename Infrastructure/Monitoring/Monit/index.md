== What is Monit ==

Monit is a server monitoring system that ensures that their services are running or enforce them to run. 

Monit has two components:
* '''monit''', an open-source agent with internal reporting
* '''M/Monit''', a paid software that ''monit'' can push updates to

=== How does ''M/Monit'' looks like ===

Those arescreenshots of '''M/Monit''' while I was testing out the feature differences between the paid app (''M/Monit'') and what comes in the open source version.
