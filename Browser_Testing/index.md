There are many great projects on the web that deal with testing and reporting browser (and authoring tool) support for Web Platform features. Our goal is to bring together the best of each of these into a shared repository of data on browser compatibility, and to provide an API for sharing and reusing this information.

There are a number of sub-projects to accomplish this goal.

==Projects==

===Data Merge===
* [[WPD:Browser_Testing/CanIUse|CanIUse Data Model]]
* [[WPD:Browser_Testing/QuirksMode|QuirksMode Data Model]]
* [[WPD:Browser_Testing/Schema|WPD Schema]]

===Browser Compatibility Table API===
'''Project Summary:''' Build an API for use on our site and by the general public for accessing information on browser support for various web programming features, integrating data from multiple different sources, such as CanIUse, Quirksmode, and W3C test suites. See the [[WPD:Compatibility_Info|Compatibility Info article]] for more information.

'''Goal:''' All articles on WebPlatform.org, and users on other sites and resources, will have access to fine-grained, test-driven, automated browser support tables for all features of the Web Platform.

===Crowdsourcing Browser Testing===
'''Project Summary:''' Build a workflow and UI for a specification test management system, including a way to select a spec, define or choose a set of testable assertions from that spec, input a test without needing to add metadata and other automatable information, submit the test for review, and collaborate in the review using a peer-reviewed upvote system. See the [[WPD:Crowdsourcing_Testing|Crowdsourcing Testing article]] for more information.

'''Goal:''' Efforts such as [http://testthewebforward.org/ Test the Web Forward] would have access to a systematic, prioritized, low-barrier, and efficient , spec-test crowdsourcing application to manage the creation, review, and community around tests.
