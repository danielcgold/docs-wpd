For an article to be considered high quality, it should adhere to all of the following guidelines. Those that do not should be tagged with the relevant banners, and may be deleted.

You might also be interested in the [[WPD:Manual_Of_Style/Section_Guidelines | style guidelines]] page, which outlines the guidelines for specific sections of pages.

==Descriptive Titles==
Choose useful titles (e.g., the name of a feature being documented)
'''TODO:''' What are the capitalization rules for this?

==Neutral Voice==
With the exception of tutorials and guides, content should maintain a neutral voice.  Because the site is a collaborative wiki, even tutorials and guides that begin with a specific voice can be expected to morph over time.

==Correct grammar and spelling==
We follow the <established Style guide we prefer> guidelines for style.

==Free of spam==
Spam makes it hard for readers of the site to find what they’re looking for, and should be removed as soon as possible.

==Vendor neutral==
Content should be vendor neutral whenever possible.

==Up to date==
Content should include any new details that may be useful for web developers.

==Tagged with all applicable tags==
Tags help users of the site find content that is relevant to them, which means that having comprehensive and complete tagging is important. This includes tags that clearly denote its standardization progress and implementation status.

==Include compatibility information==
See [[Template:Style Compatibility Issue|Compatibility]] &lt;Sub-Page&gt; for a description of the best practices for formatting compatibility information.

==Complete documentation of API==
API reference pages should document the entirety of the API, as well as any quirks or edge cases that are important to know in practice.  Relevant standards should be

==Address relevant best practices==
Authors are encouraged to address accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security good practices.

==Include examples where appropriate==
Examples help make APIs more concrete and easier to understand.

==Follow all best practices for sample code==
It is particularly important that samples and example code follow best practices (for instance, accessibility best practices regarding the use of alt text for image tags within samples), because example code is often copied by developers.

==Include citations and helpful links==
Include references to applicable standards, test suites, implementation reports, and other useful resources.

==Accessible==
The content should be accessible according to WCAG 2.0 AA. Where there are questions about accessibility, contributors should seek review from community members with more experience. Materials uploaded by agents of a browser vendor should be accessible when posted; materials uploaded by unaffiliated community members should be clearly marked if they aren’t accessible. If reasonable steps are not taken to make such material accessible after a reasonable amount of time, it may be removed from the site.

==Relevant to the site==
Articles that are not relevant to the site's goals (as laid out in the [[WPD:Pillars|Pillars]]) should not be included in the site.

==Leave comments and discussion out==
Relevant comments and discussion about the page should occur in the associated discussion page.

==Doesn't needlessly duplicate content==
Separate pages shouldn't substantially overlap content or topics except when necessary to improve understanding and organization.
