This document lists a small number of principles intended to guide the development and maintenance of the Web developer center. This is a living document that the community will develop over time. Because it expresses a small number of abstract guiding principles, it is expected to evolve slowly and only with the consensus of the community. The specific tactical details that describe how the community currently implement these ideals are covered in the Management document.

'''''Note:''' This document draws from Wikipedia practices and the community is encouraged to continue to consider their best practices.
Three Pillars of the Web Developer Center''

The web developer center is founded on three pillars:

* '''Practical:''' Provide pragmatic, comprehensive, and trustworthy content to empower web developers.
* '''Inclusive:''' Ensure the center is inclusive and accessible to all.
* '''Consensus:''' Rely on consensus and good-faith collaboration to develop content and community practices.

Below we list guiding principles for each pillar.

== Practical ==
* Content will be relevant for Web developers and designers, emphasizing practical solutions for the web ecosystem as it currently exists “what works in practice” (e.g. not only what a specification says, but tips and quirks for different browsers and authoring tools, where they differ from a specification).
* Content will be up-to-date.
* Authors will seek to build high-quality content that is trustworthy and accurate (e.g., by providing proper attribution, avoiding confusion about status, etc.).
* The stability and implementation status of features will be clearly marked; however, there is no requirement that features be stable or widely deployed to be included.

== Inclusive == 
* Content will be available at no cost.
* Content will be readable without requiring identifying information (e.g., an account).
* All people are invited to contribute content that is relevant to Web developers and designers in practice. Note however, that:
** This does not imply that all content is suitable for the center, and controversial content flagged by the community will be removed at the consensus of the administrators; controversial content may include (but is not limited to) false claims, subjective claims on the relative merits of browsers, code samples that favor one browser, and incorrect identification of the standardization status of a feature.
** Disruptive behavior may lead to people losing editing or administrative privileges.
* Content will be accessible
* Content will be translated into as many languages as possible
* Content will be available under a permissive copyright license to enable sharing and reuse.

== Consensus ==
* These principles are inspired by Wikipedia’s model, and are meant to change over time to best suit our community.
* Collaborators will assume good faith on the part of other collaborators and treat others with respect.
* People will aim for consensus while remaining attentive to practical considerations.
* People will be respectful of the content that comes before them.
* No organization or its representatives, including members of the Stewardship Committee, will exert undue influence.
* Pages will not be locked for edits except if absolutely necessary.
* Etiquette and norms are preferable to rules and processes.
* Site administration will be done transparently.

== Self-Governance and Administrators ==
The Pillars are upheld through good faith and through the guidance of the site administrators.

Administrators, commonly known as admins, are site editors trusted with access to restricted technical features ("tools"). Administrators can protect, unprotect, delete and restore pages (and consequently move pages over all existing titles, not just redirects without significant history), hide and delete page revisions, edit and move protected pages, and block other editors.

Administrators are active contributors that have earned the community’s trust to wield these powers responsibly and only in ways that reflect the will of the community. They are chosen from the community on a merit basis, through demonstration of technical ability, willingness to create, review, and edit content, and leadership of the community. Administrators who are nominated by steward organizations benefit from having their candidacy supported by a trusted community member, but enjoy no other special privileges.

=== Conflict Resolution ===
In the case where there is a conflict between administrators, the issue will be escalated to the consensus of all administrators, and if no consensus can be reached, will be decided by the Convener.
