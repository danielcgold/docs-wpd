==About Web Platform Docs==
WebPlatform is a site dedicated to documenting and teaching people about open web standards, those technologies standardized by the W3C, IETF, and other standardization bodies, which are created as part of an open process to be free for anyone to use. This project is not controlled by any one company. If you think that a technology is missing from WebPlatform, please [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_2_communicate_with_the_online_community|start a discussion]] about it.

The WebPlatform community is guided by a series of foundational principles that we call the [[WPD:Pillars|Pillars]]. The Pillars document informs the more mundane decisions and processes that govern the day-to-day operations of the site. Please read them. WebPlatform is founded on the idea that we should assume good faith cooperation and that we prefer norms over rules. These norms are documented within the wiki itself, in the WPD namespace (to keep the pages separate from web documentation content). Learn more by visiting the [[WPD:Policy| Policy page]].
