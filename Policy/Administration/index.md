## Self-Governance and Administrators

The Pillars are upheld through good faith and through the guidance of the site administrators.

Administrators, commonly known as admins, are site editors trusted with access to restricted technical features ("tools"). Administrators can protect, unprotect, delete and restore pages (and consequently move pages over all existing titles, not just redirects without significant history), hide and delete page revisions, edit and move protected pages, and block other editors.

Administrators are active contributors that have earned the communityâ€™s trust to wield these powers responsibly and only in ways that reflect the will of the community. They are chosen from the community on a merit basis, through demonstration of technical ability, willingness to create, review, and edit content, and leadership of the community. Administrators who are nominated by steward organizations benefit from having their candidacy supported by a trusted community member, but enjoy no other special privileges.

### Conflict Resolution

In the case where there is a conflict between administrators, the issue will be escalated to the consensus of all administrators, and if no consensus can be reached, will be decided by the Convener.
