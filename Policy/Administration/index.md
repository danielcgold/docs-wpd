== Self-Governance and Administrators ==
The Pillars are upheld through good faith and through the guidance of the site administrators.

Administrators, commonly known as admins, are site editors trusted with access to restricted technical features ("tools"). Administrators can protect, unprotect, delete and restore pages (and consequently move pages over all existing titles, not just redirects without significant history), hide and delete page revisions, edit and move protected pages, and block other editors.

Administrators are active contributors that have earned the communityâ€™s trust to wield these powers responsibly and only in ways that reflect the will of the community. They are chosen from the community on a merit basis, through demonstration of technical ability, willingness to create, review, and edit content, and leadership of the community. Administrators who are nominated by steward organizations benefit from having their candidacy supported by a trusted community member, but enjoy no other special privileges.

=== Conflict Resolution ===
In the case where there is a conflict between administrators, the issue will be escalated to the consensus of all administrators, and if no consensus can be reached, will be decided by the Convener.

==Administration==

The administration of content and the overall community is based largely upon the model proven effective by the Wikipedia community.The goal is that the community shall be self-policing and shall create a code of interactivity that reflects the cooperative nature of the site. To that extent: [a]

* Any user whom the community collectively trusts to be a productive member of the community and uphold the three pillars may be promoted to administrator. When someone wants to become an administrator, they need to make a request to the existing admins group, and they will approve it on a case by case basis. The process will be documented somewhere on the admin pages of the site.
* Administrators may block users, promote other users to administrators, or delete, rename, move, or lock pages.
* Administrators must use their privileges in a manner consistent with the Community Charter (or else they may lose those privileges).
* We expect that Administrators will post relevant administrative information on a portion of the site.
* The community will have a means to contact Administrators to inform them of issues that require attention, including out of date content, offensive content, edit wars, etc.
