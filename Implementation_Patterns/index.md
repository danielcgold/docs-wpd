Web Platform Docs is currently built on MediaWiki (the same piece of software that Wikipedia is built on) and makes extensive use of two extensions, Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) and Semantic Forms, to organize information in a structured way, help make sure that articles have a consistent organization, and make it easier for mere mortals to edit articles.

This guide reviews a number of concepts related to these software packages, as well as how we use them to implement our organization on WPD, to help give the fledgling editor a good place to get started. This guide is ''not'' designed to be a comprehensive manual of style (we've already [[WPD:Manual_Of_Style|got one]]), but rather a guide to how all of these concepts are implemented.

The vast majority of editors will only have to use the (relatively) easy-to-use forms that we've created. A small number of editors, however, may want to understand how we've wired everything together so they can help modify or add to the information structure. We'll cover those two classes of use in two sections.
