Web Platform Docs is currently built on MediaWiki (the same piece of software that Wikipedia is built on) and makes extensive use of two extensions, Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) and Semantic Forms, to organize information in a structured way, help make sure that articles have a consistent organization, and make it easier for mere mortals to edit articles.

This guide reviews a number of concepts related to these software packages, as well as how we use them to implement our organization on WPD, to help give the fledgling editor a good place to get started.
