<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_norms">The norms</span></h2>
<p>The WPD community is guided by a series of foundational norms that we call the <a href="/wiki/WPD:Pillars" title="WPD:Pillars" class="mw-redirect">WPD Pillars</a>. The Pillars document is a list of guiding principles that informs the more mundane norms and processes that govern the day-to-day operations of the site. You should read them carefully, but what's most important to know is that WPD is founded on the idea that we should assume good faith cooperation and that we prefer norms over rules. These norms and rules are documented within the wiki itself, in the WPD namespace (to keep it separate from documentation content). You can find the more mundane norms listed at <a href="/wiki/WPD:Policy" title="WPD:Policy">WPD:Policy</a>.
