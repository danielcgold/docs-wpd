## Stickers

We need to define quantity as large discounts available for larger batches.

What type of stickers do we want?

-   size?
-   shape: square, square with rounded corners, round, custom shape (e.g. the shape of the logo)?
-   sticker sheets, or a single sticker?

### StickerMule

We plan to use [stickermule](http://www.stickermule.com/products/square-stickers). This tends to be the cheapest option. Open to see if folks have other vendors that are cheaper.

### Sticker Robot

Another alternative is [Sticker Robot](http://stickerobot.com/order/), which seems to be slightly cheaper.

## Note Pads

We can print custom art as a **gray scale** on every page, and this adds only a set-up of \$150.00, if the quantity is greater than 2500 units! For 1k units, we have the same above setup charge + \$0.55 per piece. This gives you an idea of cost. We need the template of the site to estimate cost for color printing (recommended). Images of covers are below (indicative).

### Sticky-Note Notebooks

Another option is flip-top notebooks with a collection of sticky notes, as available on [Discount Mugs](http://www.discountmugs.com/nc/view-product/NOT21/525-x-7-in-eco-flip-top-notebooks-with-sticky-notes/). They are \$2.15 in lots of 1000+, and \$2.09 in lots of 2500+, with no setup fee, with a single-color logo on cover.
