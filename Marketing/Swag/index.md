==Stickers==
We need to define quantity as large discounts available for larger batches.

What type of stickers do we want?
* size?
* shape: square, square with rounded corners, round, custom shape (e.g. the shape of the logo)?
* sticker sheets, or a single sticker?

===StickerMule===
We plan to use [http://www.stickermule.com/products/square-stickers stickermule]. This tends to be the cheapest option. Open to see if folks have other vendors that are cheaper. 

===Sticker Robot===
Another alternative is [http://stickerobot.com/order/ Sticker Robot], which seems to be slightly cheaper.

==Note Pads==
We can print custom art as a '''gray scale''' on every page, and this adds only a set-up of $150.00, if the quantity is greater than 2500 units!  For 1k units, we have the same above setup charge + $0.55 per piece.  This gives you an idea of cost. We need the template of the site to estimate cost for color printing (recommended). Images of covers are below (indicative).

===Sticky-Note Notebooks===
Another option is flip-top notebooks with a collection of sticky notes, as available on [http://www.discountmugs.com/nc/view-product/NOT21/525-x-7-in-eco-flip-top-notebooks-with-sticky-notes/ Discount Mugs]. They are $2.15 in lots of 1000+, and $2.09 in lots of 2500+, with no setup fee, with a single-color logo on cover.
