title: WPD:Marketing/Posting Guidelines

<div class="note">
<p><b>Note</b>: Are you a member of the community with a great idea for a blog post or tweet? Propose it on IRC or on public-webplatform!

These are the guidelines for how to handle blog posts, tweets, G+ posts, and any other posts on behalf of Web Platform Docs on official channels.
</p><p>Multiple people have access to the login for each channel. These people need not work directly for a steward organization, but they should be trusted by the community. The number of people with access to each channel should be kept to the minimum. Passwords should be treated incredibly carefully and never shared on any public channel (obviously).
</p><p>The tone for all communications is:
</p>
<ul><li> Positive</li>
<li> Inclusive</li>
<li> Centered on Web Platform Docs, not other products, organizations or sites</li></ul>
<p><b>Anyone who does not meet these guidelines (either the letter or spirit) will have their posting privileges revoked immediately.</b>
</p>

<ul><li> Anyone may propose a blog topic or blog post draft.</li>
<li> Posts may be "signed" by any member of the community (with their permission, of course)</li>

<li> Summarizing and linking to WPD posts on other channels (like Google+)</li>
<li> Responding to direct questions or mentions</li>
<li> <i>This list will grow over time</i></li></ul></li>
<li> <b>Every</b> proposed tweet <b>must</b> be posted to the <b>webplatform-site</b> IRC channel and receive at least one <b>SGTM</b> from a trusted member of the community (e.g. an administrator). New post types or posts that are potentially controversial should seek more approval before posting.</li></ul>

<li> Summarizing and linking to WPD posts on other channels (like Twitter)</li>
<li> Responding to direct questions or mentions</li></ul></li>
<li> Because Google+ allows longer or more in-depth discussions, often it is appropriate to extend shorter tweets into more substantial posts.</li>
<li> <b>Every</b> proposed post and comment  <b>must</b> be posted to the <b>webplatform-site</b> IRC channel and receive at least one <b>SGTM</b> from a trusted member of the community (e.g. an administrator).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_new_channels">Adding new channels</span></h2>
<ul><li> Every so often we may want to include more channels in our official line-up (e.g. a Facebook page). These need to be approved by the member-webdocs list.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Handling_unofficial_channels">Handling unofficial channels</span></h2>
<ul><li> Although we encourage members of the community to share news about Web Platform Docs in their own ways, we require that <b>any unofficial channels be positioned in a way that makes it clear that they are not official.</b></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Videos">Videos</span></h2>
<p>Videos must always be approved by the member-webdocs list. They also must include the standard intro/outro.
