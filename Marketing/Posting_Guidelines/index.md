These are the guidelines for how to handle blog posts, tweets, G+ posts, and any other posts on behalf of Web Platform Docs.

Multiple people have access to the login for each channel. These people need not work directly for a steward organization, but they should be trusted by the community. The number of people with access to each channel should be kept to the minimum. Passwords should be treated incredibly carefully and never shared on any public channel (obviously).

'''Posters''': Doug, Ian, ''others?''
The following guidelines must be met:
* Anyone may propose a blog topic or blog post draft.
* Posts may be "signed" by any member of the community (with their permission, of course)
* Topics we normally post about:
** Updates on community events
** Posts on infrastructure
** Achievement of milestones
** Weekly stats summary
** Calling out special community contributions
** Linking to videos or other posts directly about Web Platform Docs.
** ''This list will grow over time''
* Tone:
** Positive
** Inclusive
** Centered on Web Platform Docs, not other products, organizations or sites
* Every proposed blog post must be posted by a member of member-webdocs (perhaps on behalf of another submitter) to that list. The post may not go live until either: '''two independent "Sounds Good To Me" responses''' are received on that list, or '''12 hours''' have passed. Post types that do not have precedent or are potentially controversial must get at least two active SGTMs.
