These are the guidelines for how to handle blog posts, tweets, G+ posts, and any other posts on behalf of Web Platform Docs.

Multiple people have access to the login for each channel. These people need not work directly for a steward organization, but they should be trusted by the community. The number of people with access to each channel should be kept to the minimum. Passwords should be treated incredibly carefully and never shared on any public channel (obviously).

The tone for all communications is:
* Positive
* Inclusive
* Centered on Web Platform Docs, not other products, organizations or sites

'''Anyone who does not meet these guidelines (either the letter or spirit) will have their posting privileges revoked immediately.'''

'''Posters''': Doug, ''others?''

The following guidelines must be met:
* Anyone may propose a blog topic or blog post draft.
* Posts may be "signed" by any member of the community (with their permission, of course)
* Topics we normally post about:
** Updates on community events
** Posts on infrastructure
** Achievement of milestones
** Weekly stats summary
** Calling out special community contributions
** Linking to videos or other posts directly about Web Platform Docs.
** ''This list will grow over time''
* Every proposed blog post must be posted by a member of member-webdocs (perhaps on behalf of another submitter) to that list. The post may not go live until either: '''two independent "Sounds Good To Me" responses''' are received on that list, or '''12 hours''' have passed. Post types that do not have precedent or are potentially controversial must get at least two active SGTMs.

== @WebPlatform Twitter handle ==
'''Posters''': Doug, ''others?''
* Topics we normally post about:
** Summarizing and linking to WPD blog posts
** Summarizing and linking to WPD posts on other channels (like Google+)
** Responding to direct questions or mentions
** ''This list will grow over time''
* '''Every''' proposed tweet '''must''' be posted to the '''webplatform-site''' IRC channel and receive at least one '''SGTM''' from a trusted member of the community (e.g. an administrator). New post types or posts that are potentially controversial should seek more approval before posting.

== @webplatform on Google+ ==
'''Owner''': Doug

'''Posters''': Paul, Alex, Peter, ??
* Topics we normally post about:
** Summarizing and linking to WPD blog posts
** Summarizing and linking to WPD posts on other channels (like Google+)
** Responding to direct questions or mentions
* Because Google+ allows longer or more in-depth discussions, often it is appropriate to extend shorter tweets into more substantial posts.
* '''Every''' proposed post '''must''' be posted to the '''webplatform-site''' IRC channel and receive at least one '''SGTM''' from a trusted member of the community (e.g. an administrator). New post types or posts that are potentially controversial should seek more approval before posting.

== Adding new channels ==
* Every so often we may want to include more channels in our official line-up (e.g. a Facebook page). These need to be approved by the member-webdocs list.

== Handling unofficial channels ==
* Although we encourage members of the community to share news about Web Platform Docs in their own ways, we require that '''any unofficial channels be positioned in a way that makes it clear that they are not official.'''
