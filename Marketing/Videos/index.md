## Luminaries Videos

Short description: Show many people that the industry respects e.g. Tim but also Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn and others representing ideally some of the stewards covering the below:

-   The web has done well but we need to get the platform to grow up
-   We have all been working together on building standards, experimenting with technologies etc
-   The key to a good platform is good tools, documentation etc. And to be honest we have not done well historically there.
-   We can change this together!
-   Discuss the site, how the community is coming together to achieve a goal \* this proves that even big companies care about investing in the platform and that we all work together for the common good.
-   All of us need to participate and can leave our mark
-   Show them signing up to be part of this and contributing an article.

## Marketing-y Video

*Low priority*

-   Show someone looking to solve a problem that is hard e.g. implement a feature handled differently across browsers.. show frantic searches, clicks to many sites, hitting the back button etc.
-   Show a conversation on IRC, or chat messages or stackoverflow messages where the frustration comes out and someone responding with web platform docs..
-   Show clicking on link to the site and then exploring the content
-   Show signing up to contribute
-   can be done in animation or some other visual style that makes it look cool.
