<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Create_valid_URLs_for_new_pages">Create valid URLs for new pages</span></h3>
<p>Next, go to the <a href="/wiki/WPD:New_Page" title="WPD:New Page"> New Page page</a> and create a new page using one of the defined content page templates. When you create pages, remember that the text you enter in the path text box becomes the URL for the new page. Also note that the page URL does not need to match the visible page title. 
</p><p>For example, a page with the URL: eventsource_basics can have an internal title: Streaming updates with server-sent events. The goal is to keep URLs short, descriptive, and unique.
</p>
<ul><li>Do not capitalize words in a URL unless absolutely vital for syntax correctness. For example, if you are authoring an article about user media, you can enter: usermedia; for an article specifically about the getUserMedia method, you might instead enter: getUserMedia.</li>
<li>Use spaces, not underscores, to separate words in a URL, because underscores are generated automatically in place of spaces when the page is created. For example, if you are creating a new article about the HTML5 audio tag, you can enter: audio tag and the generated URL will be: audio_tag.</li>
<li>Do not use other punctuation, such as dashes or parentheses, in a URL. This is especially important because adding punctuation in URLs causes major site issues.</li>
<li>Do not use articles (the, a, an) in URLs unless absolutely necessary.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Topics_and_topic_clusters">Topics and topic clusters</span></h3>
<p>Generally, we use topics to describe articles at their lowest level of granularity - what the article is about. An article may have more than one topic. We use topic clusters to group articles of similar topics. Topic clusters produce a list of related topics in the See Also section. The following sections describe the use cases of topics and topic clusters.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Topics_use_cases">Topics use cases</span></h3>
<p>Use topics to describe the article for the following purposes. Note that these use cases are not mutually exclusive, and you can use topics for either or both.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_meta_data">Basic meta data</span></h4>
<p>Topics describe the article's content with keywords. Mark as many as apply <i>usefully</i>. Too much meta data can blur the picture worse than too little. The topic keywords have several uses, such as search engine optimization, and effectively describe the content taxonomy. This taxonomy has multiple facets. For example, the CSS-Regions API is an API (the content's purpose) and it is about CSS (the content's subject matter); furthermore, it is specifically about CSS-Regions. But the CSS-Regions topic tag is more than general meta data, it is used specifically to delineate structure and navigation. See next.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="API_Basic_Listing_Configuration_Query">API Basic Listing Configuration Query</span></h4>
<p>Use a topic to describe the article within the context of its template type (these are described in the <a href="/wiki/WPD:New_Page" title="WPD:New Page">WPD:New_Page</a> page). That is, if the page is for an API object (which uses the API_Object template), and the article is about the CSS-Regions API, then the topic checkbox to check is "CSS-Regions." This allows you to specify the query, "[[Category:CSS-Regions]][[Category:API_Objects]]" in the API_Listing page that produces a summary table of all the API objects. This query says, "fetch me the pages of the CSS-Regions topic that are also API_Object pages." This means that for every API there must be a topic specific to that API.
</p><p>Notice that the query does not select for the more general Category:CSS. If there were other CSS-related JavaScript APIs, let's say CSS-Overlay (this is fake), and if both the CSS-Regions and CSS-Overlay API_Listing pages queried for Category:CSS, all of the objects from both APIs would appear in each API's summary table. The way to prevent such duplication from happening is to create a discrete topic for all of the API_Object pages within one API_Listing.
</p><p>See <a href="/wiki/WPD:Creating_API_pages#Object_listing_page_content" title="WPD:Creating API pages">Creating API pages</a> for more information. See <a href="/wiki/WPD:Topics" title="WPD:Topics" class="mw-redirect">WPD:Topics</a> for how to create new topics.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Topic_clusters_use_case">Topic clusters use case</span></h3>
<p>To produce a list of articles of related content in the See Also section, use a topic cluster. The key here is to get articles from across the many domains of the wiki - tutorials, concepts, APIs, HTML elements, and so on. Sometimes these articles will share a common term, like "WebRTC." But sometimes the common term won't be obvious.
</p><p>For example, with three Timing APIs - <a href="/wiki/apis/navigation_timing" title="apis/navigation timing">apis/navigation_timing</a>, <a href="/wiki/apis/resource_timing" title="apis/resource timing">apis/resource_timing</a>, <a href="/wiki/apis/user_timing" title="apis/user timing">apis/user_timing</a> - you might think these should share the "Timing" topic cluster. But then your topic cluster would miss all of the articles about optimization, debugging, and performance. Probably the best topic cluster to use in this case is "Performance."
</p><p><b>Careful!</b> It is easy to abuse topic clusters by tagging too many articles for the same topic cluster. Doing so only creates a long list of unnecessary links. For example, API object members (events, methods, and properties) do not need to be in the topic cluster; only the API object needs to be in the topic cluster. Furthermore, avoid using large-scope topic clusters like "CSS" - again, all you'll get is a huge list of unrelated items.
</p><p>To create a new topic cluster, add it to the list in <a href="/wiki/Property:Topic_Cluster" title="Property:Topic Cluster">Property:Topic_Cluster</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Update_the_status_of_compatibility">Update the status of compatibility</span></h3>
<p>If you complete the compatibility tables on a page (for both desktop and mobile browsers), you can deselect the Compatibility Incomplete check box in the Content section just below the page title, to the left of the text in the English version.  
</p><p>If you are editing or authoring a page and you feel that compatibility information is not needed (and the page is currently <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.webplatform.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&amp;target=Template%3ACompat+Unknown&amp;namespace=">listed as a page with missing compatibility information</a> because the template flags compatibility as missing by default), you can check the box immediately under the Compatibility section header to indicate that this section is not needed (and ensure it will not appear on the site). Be sure to also deselect the Compatibility Incomplete check box near the top of the page as described above.
</p><p>Your final summary (commit) comment should mention if you have changed the status of the compatibility information. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Upload_and_link_images_or_other_assets_to_pages">Upload and link images or other assets to pages</span></h3>
<p>Visit <a href="/wiki/WPD:Editors_Guide/step_7_prepare_and_upload_assets_for_articles" title="WPD:Editors Guide/step 7 prepare and upload assets for articles"> Step 7 of the Editor's Guide</a> to learn how to prepare and upload image files and other assets. Once a file is uploaded, you can add links to it. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Save_your_work">Save your work</span></h3>
<p>After completing your edits on a page, enter a summary of your changes in the Summary field, check the box for a minor edit if you only tweaked existing information, click the Show preview button to review your work (recommended), and then click Save page button to save your changes.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>Note</b>: If you have been editing for a while without saving, your session information may be stale, and you may be presented with the following warning message:
</p><p><b>Sorry! We could not process your edit due to a loss of session data. Please try again....</b> (along with a deceptively updated preview of your unprocessed new version, and the edited source). 
</p><p>When you see this error, click the Save page button again. In most cases, simply resubmitting the form will work (because the first attempt refreshes your session, and the second attempt enables the submission to process).
