==Join the public-webplatform@w3.org mailing list==
* We announce initiatives and discuss proposals on the W3.org mailing list. [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/ Subscribe] to the w3.org mailing list to stay in touch.

==Ask questions or help others in the forum==
* Log into the [http://talk.webplatform.org/forums/ WebPlatform forum].

==Access the bug-tracking system==
* WebPlatform uses the [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=webplatform.org W3.org bugbase] to track issues. Be sure to [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/query.cgi?product=webplatform.org search the bugbase] before entering any new bugs.
* We track two types of bugs in Bugzilla:
** Site functionality bugs, including errors and UI issues
** Multiple page content problems related to entire groups of pages 
 Note: If an issue is related to a specific page, [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_4_review_existing_content|flag a page]] to mark issues.

===Log bugs using the following guidelines===

# '''All bugs should include''': 
#* Steps to reproduce the issue 
#* URLs of the affected pages 
#* Your browser type and version 
#* The date you found the bug 
#* Screenshots (if you are logging a UI issue)
# '''Priority changes''' are set when initially creating the bug, or by one of the following project leads only:
#* Content: Janet, Chris, Eliot, Doug
#* Marketing: Alex, Christos, Ian
#* Infrastructure: Doug, Alex
#* Hackathon: Peter
# '''Assign all bugs to someone specific'''. If you are not sure, see the [[WPD:Key_Contributors| list of key contributors]] or assign bugs to: ssweeney@arborheights.net.
# '''Assign bugs to one of the project leads when possible''' so that they can delegate tasks.
# '''Use this priority system when adding bugs''': 
#* Pri 1 - Must have, we can't release without it
#* Pri 2 - Should have, the release will suffer without it
#* Pri 3 - Nice to have
#* Pri 4 - OK to wait until the next release to resolve

==Browse Existing Bugs==
* [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/describecomponents.cgi?product=webplatform.org Peruse all open bugs by component]
* [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&list_id=173&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=webplatform.org List all open webplatform.org bugs]

==Follow these steps to file bugs==

# Log into the W3C's [http://www.w3.org/Bugs/ Bugzilla bug tracking system].
# [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/query.cgi?product=webplatform.org Search the bugbase] before entering any new bugs, to make sure it hasn't been filed already. 
# Visit the [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi Enter Bug] page.
# Choose the [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=webplatform.org webplatform.org] link.
# There are many options; the most important fields to fill in are:
#* '''Summary''': Enter a descriptive but short summary.
#* '''Description''': Enter a more detailed description that specifies the issue. Include steps needed to reproduce the bug, in a numbered list. Describe  the expected/desired behavior and the actual behavior you encountered.
#* '''Component''': Select the component that corresponds to the bug. You can choose:
#** '''Comment Extension''' — if the problem relates specifically to the comments extension used to add comments to a section of a page.
#** '''Content''' — if the problem relates to the content of a set of pages, rather than the appearance and implementation of pages.
#** '''Default''' — choose this if you are not sure which component applies to your bug.
#** '''Info Architecture''' — if the problem is specific to the organization of the pages on the site.
#** '''Infrastructure''' — if the problem relates to how the wiki site is implemented, including database bugs and JavaScript bugs.
#** '''Skin''' — if the problem relates to the visual design (the look and feel of the site).
When you are finished, press the '''Submit bug''' button at the bottom of the page.

You will receive notifications via e-mail when the status of your bug changes or whenever comments are added.
