==Step 2. Communicate with the online community==
===Join IRC channel.===
* The WebPlatform.org online community uses IRC extensively. Log in and ask questions.
* http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform
* Or download and install an IRC client that enables you to chat in the #webplatform channel. Here are some reliable IRC clients you can use:
** http://www.mirc.com mIRC (Windows)
** http://xchat.org/ Xchat (Windows and Linux)
** http://colloquy.info/downloads.html Colloquy (Mac)
** http://limechat.net/mac/ LimeChat (Mac)
** http://pidgin.im/ Pidgin (Mac)
***** [COMMENT:] [PULL CONTENT FROM: http://talk.webplatform.org/chat/]
** In the IRC client, connect to the WebPlatform channel.

* Log in anytime you want to share ideas or ask questions
***** [COMMENT:] No change to the Meetings pages.
* Log in during meetings. Here are the meeting calendars and the archives of meeting notes:
** http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Meetings 
** http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Content_Meetings
===Join the public-webplatform@w3.org.===
* We announce initiatives and work out proposals on the W3.org mailing list. Subscribe to the w3.org mailing list.
** public-webplatform@w3.org
** http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/
===Ask questions or help others in the forum.===
* http://talk.webplatform.org/forums/
***** [COMMENT:] REALLY wish this was called "Forums" not Q&A - which sounds like an FAQ list to me. Is it possible to set up a forum channel for contributors to ask questions about editing or authoring content to the wiki? (Rather than just general web questions).
===Access the bug-tracking system.===
