==Step 2. Communicate with the online community==
===Join the conversation on the IRC channel===
* The WebPlatform.org online community uses IRC extensively. [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#webplatform| Log in using a browser and ask the team questions].
* Or download and install an IRC client that enables you to chat in the #webplatform channel. Here are some reliable IRC clients you can download:
** [http://www.mirc.com| mIRC] (Windows)
** [http://xchat.org/| Xchat] (Windows and Linux)
** [http://colloquy.info/downloads.html| Colloquy] (Mac)
** [http://limechat.net/mac/| LimeChat] (Mac)
** [http://pidgin.im/| Pidgin] (Mac)
===Connect to the WebPlatform channel with an IRC client using these settings===
* Server: Freenode (irc.freenode.net)
* Channel: #webplatform
** If you are new to using IRC, check out this [http://richard.esplins.org/siwi/2011/07/08/getting-started-freenode-irc/| helpful guide].
** Log in to the IRC channel during scheduled [[WPD:Content_Meetings| meetings]] or anytime you want to share ideas or ask questions. 

===Join the public-webplatform@w3.org mailing list===
* We announce initiatives and discuss proposals on the W3.org mailing list. [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/ Subscribe] to the w3.org mailing list to stay in touch.

===Ask questions or help others in the forum===
* Log into the [http://talk.webplatform.org/forums/| WebPlatform forum].

===Access the bug-tracking system===
* WebPlatform uses the [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=webplatform.org| W3.org bugbase] to track issues. Be sure to [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/query.cgi?product=webplatform.org| search the bugbase] before entering new bugs.
* We track two types of bugs in Bugzilla:
** Site functionality bugs, including errors and UI issues.
** Multiple page content problems related to entire groups of pages 
 Note: If an issue is related to a specific page, [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_4_review_existing_content| flag a page]] to mark issues.

Use the following guidelines:

# '''If it not in bugzilla, it doesn't exist.'''  If you are working on something that takes more than an hour or that you can't get to immediately, please log it as a bug.  That includes marketing tasks.
# '''First, check if there is an existing bug report on your issue.''' If so, add a comment there instead. (Duplicate bug reports cost us time.) 
# '''All bugs should include''': 
#* reproduction steps, 
#* URLs, 
#* browser type and version, 
#* when you found the bug, 
#* and screenshots if a UI issue
# '''Priority changes''' should only be done when initially creating the bug, or by me or one of the following TF leads only:
#* Content: Janet, Chris, Eliot, Doug
#* Marketing: Alex, Christos, Ian
#* Infrastructure: Doug, Alex
#* Hackathon: Peter
# '''Assign all bugs to someone specific''', and not Doug Null and not a group in general.  If in doubt, assign to me: ssweeney@arborheights.net.<br /><br />
# '''Assign to one of the TF leads when possible''' and have them do any delegatation.  During the war room, we need to be able to discuss each and every bug.  If a bug is assigned to someone not in the war room, I need the TF leads to at least understand the latest with those bugs and be able to discuss the bug in the war room.
# '''Our priority system''': 
#* Pri 1 - Must have, can't release without
#* Pri 2 - Should have, release will suffer without it
#* Pri 3 - Nice to have
#* Pri 4 - Next release, out of scope for sure for this release
