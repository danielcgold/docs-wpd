Sometimes it's just easier to communicate in an IRC channel with a client. You can download and install an IRC client that enables you to chat in the \#webplatform channel.

-   Here are some reliable IRC clients you can download:
    -   [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com) (Windows)
    -   [Xchat](http://xchat.org/) (Windows and Linux)
    -   [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/downloads.html) (Mac)
    -   [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) (Mac)
    -   [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) (Mac)
