==Step 7. Prepare and upload assets for articles==

When adding images to an article, carefully consider the optimal dimensions of the image file (such as 300 pixels x 150 pixels), the minimal acceptable quality of the image (which dictates the image's file size in KB), and a descriptive file name. Ensure accessibility of the images you upload and link, by adding alt text in articles to describe the visual content for screen readers.

* Images should only be as large as required to display the content to be portrayed. To fit inside the content column on WPD, you should make them no larger than about 650 pixels wide. If an image absolutely needs to be much larger than this, you should display a thumbnail and then link it to a full size image somewhere else.
* Please do not try to load images of several MB to this wiki! If the dimensions of an image exceed 650 pixels wide, use an image-editing program to resize the image and save a smaller version. If the image does not contain very detailed imagery (like a line drawing), it is usually best to save the file using the PNG 8 format. (Most image-editing programs offer this option in their export settings.) If the image is more detailed, such as a browser screenshot or photograph, save the file using the JPEG format with 70% quality. You can use an image compression application such as [[http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/ PNG Crush]].</p></li>
* Save images with appropriate semantic file names. For example, use '''box-shadow-output.jpg''', rather than '''my-great-image.jpg''' or '''454654756-awesome.jpg'''.
* To add alt text to images in Media Wiki, you use the option alt=my alt text. So for example:

<pre>[[Image:cssbasic.png|alt=Screenshot of the Opera browser showing an applied inline style sheet]]</pre>

<p>Maps to</p>

<pre><img src="cssbasic.png alt="Screenshot of the Opera browser showing an applied inline style sheet"></pre>


===Optimize files.===
* Optimize PNG image files and resize to a maximum width of 650px. Some popular optimizers are:
** http://www.pngoptimizer.com/
***** [COMMENT:] This will require a new page. 
** http://pixenate.com/
===Name image file names descriptively.===
* Right: chrome_prefs.png, drop_shadow.png, box_model_diagram.png
* Wrong: image 04.png, screenshot.png, figure10.png, code.png
===Use the Upload File page to upload the images.===
* http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Special:Upload
===Add the link to an uploaded image in the article draft.===
* Enter the syntax to link the uploaded image file in the article: &#91;&#91;File:File.jpg&#93;&#93;
