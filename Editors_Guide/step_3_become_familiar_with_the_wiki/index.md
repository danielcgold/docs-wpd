==Step 3: Become familiar with the wiki==
===If you can't wait, start contributing right away===
Begin reviewing, marking, and editing pages using these resources:
* Follow the steps outlined in the [[WPD:Getting_Started| Getting Started page]].
* Check out [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_4_review_existing_content| Step 4]] to learn how to add comments and flag pages.
* Review [[WPD:Editors_Guide/step_5_update_existing_content| Step 5]] to see how to use the correct wiki syntax.

===Understand the WebPlatform project's mission and policies===
* Watch the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ug6XAw6hzaw| shorter project overview video] or the [https://developers.google.com/live/shows/ahNzfmdvb2dsZS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzcg4LEgVFdmVudBiomqIEDA/ longer project video] to learn about the goals of the WebPlatform wiki.

***** [COMMENT:] Rename Getting Started to Getting Started Contributing Content. Shorten the Getting Started page to include less overlap - more links to relevant pages. 
** Or watch the shorter version:
***** [COMMENT:] Is one video preferred over the other? Looking forward to additional videos specific to getting started.

* Read the FAQ and site policies and look at the direction we're going in.

***** [COMMENT:] All three of these pages should be edited. The Task Roadmap page will soon be replaced by a project management system, like Bug Genie.
** http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Task_Roadmap 
***** [COMMENT:] Recommend updating the Policy page to begin with content in Pillars page, above the links.
