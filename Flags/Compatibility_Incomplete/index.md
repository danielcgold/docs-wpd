title: WPD:Flags/Compatibility Incomplete
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have incomplete compatibility tables. In practice this flag is often automatically set by cells in the table that say "Unknown" or "Supported (when?)". There is no associated editorial flag; instead, use "Unknown" in some compatibility table cells to automatically set it. If the row that should exist does not yet, create the row and leave it empty, which will automatically set this flag.

<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>Once every cell in the compatibility table is filled in with specific versions or "Unsupported" this flag may be removed.
