This flag should be checked for articles that have incomplete compatibility tables. In practice this flag is often automatically set by cells in the table that say "Unknown" or "Supported (when?)". There is no associated editorial flag; instead, use "Unknown" in some compatibility table cells to automatically set it. If the row that should exist does not yet, create the row and leave it empty, which will automatically set this flag.
