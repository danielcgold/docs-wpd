uri: 'WPD:Flags/Examples Needed'

This flag should be checked for articles that are missing examples but should have them. In practice this flag is often automatically checked for pages with an examples section that have no examples and do not have "No examples needed" checked. You *may* use the associated editorial block to describe the kinds of examples that should be included if you wish.

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## Work Items

Once all required examples are provided this flag may be removed. Note that they don't need to be perfect because there are other flags for examples that do not work or do not follow best practices.

## Editorial Block

You may use the associated editorial block to provide additional context on what examples are necessary: [Template:Editorial/Examples\_Needed](/Template:Editorial/Examples_Needed).

The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
