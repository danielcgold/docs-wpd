This flag is used to mark pages that do not yet have all appropriate topics (and topic clusters) associated. Correctly tagging articles with appropriate topics and topic clusters is important because many listing pages are automatically generated based on them.

==Manual of Style==
{{TODO | Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.}}

==Work Items==
If an article has this flag, figure out which [[WPD:Topics|topics]] and [[Property:Topic_Cluster|topic clusters]] it should have and apply them. Then you can remove this flag and get started working through those work items!

==Editorial Block==
This flag uses the [[Template:Editorial/Needs_Topics|Editorial/Needs_Topics]] editorial note to provide more detail around which topics should be used. This note generally goes at the top of the page.
