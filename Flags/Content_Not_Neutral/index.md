title: WPD:Flags/Content Not Neutral
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have some content that privileges some vendors or browsers over others. You should also mark the specific content that is not vendor neutral using the associated Editorial block. Note that there are more specific flags for incorrectness in some areas, like examples, compatibility tables, etc. In practice this often occurs with content that originally came from a source that focused on one browser.

<p>Be sure to mark which content has vendor neutrality problems using the associated editorial block: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Content_Not_Neutral" title="Template:Editorial/Content Not Neutral">Template:Editorial/Content_Not_Neutral</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the non-neutral content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the non-neutral pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
</p><p>If <i>most</i> of the content is not neutral, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
