title: WPD:Flags/Examples Errors
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have examples that have errors&#8212;that is, the example wouldn't work correctly. You <i>may</i> use the associated editorial block to describe the problem if you wish.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>Once all examples on the page work correctly you may remove this flag.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>You may use the associated editorial block to provide additional context on what examples are necessary: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Examples_Errors" title="Template:Editorial/Examples Errors">Template:Editorial/Examples_Errors</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
