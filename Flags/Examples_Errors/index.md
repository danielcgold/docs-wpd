This flag should be checked for articles that have examples that have errors&mdash;that is, the example wouldn't work correctly. You ''may'' use the associated editorial block to describe the problem if you wish.

==Manual of Style==
{{TODO | Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to}}

==Work Items==
Once all examples on the page work correctly you may remove this flag.

==Editorial Block==

You may use the associated editorial block to provide additional context on what examples are necessary: [[Template:Editorial/Examples_Errors]].

The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
