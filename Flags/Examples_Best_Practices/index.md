title: WPD:Flags/Examples Best Practices
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have examples that do not follow all applicable best practices as outline in the style guide. Many users will copy and paste code from examples, so it's important to set a good example. You <i>may</i> use the associated editorial block to describe the problem if you wish.

<p>Once all examples on the page follow all of the best practices for examples as outlined in the style guide you may remove this flag.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>You may use the associated editorial block to provide additional context on what best practices are necessary: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Examples_Best_Practices" title="Template:Editorial/Examples Best Practices">Template:Editorial/Examples_Best_Practices</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
