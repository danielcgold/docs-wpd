At WPD we use a system of Flags to mark articles that need work done on them. This helps the community keep track of what needs to be done and create automatic lists of things to do.

Flags are used in conjunction with Editorial templates to provide more details. Whereas flags are used to mark high-level issues and allow editors to locate articles that require specific kinds of work, Editorial notes are used to describe what specifically sections of the page require.

See more detail about each flag to see how it's used and what Editorial notes it should be used in conjunction with.

==List of Work Item Flags==
These articles mark work items that an article needs to bring it up to our quality standards. We seek to fix the issues that the flags address and get to zero work-item flags. Many of these flags are directly inspired by points in the [[WPD:Style_Manual|Style Manual]].

Different flags have different guidelines for when they should be used, and for if they should have editorial notes used along with them. '''Be sure to read the notes on each flag before using it.'''

==List of Categorization Flags==

{{TODO | These aren't implemented as "Flags" anymore, but normal form fields.}}

'''We will revisit this whole thing in the future. On hold for now.'''

These are flags that call out special status of articles. They do not represent work that must be done on the article, but rather properties of the things the article documents.
===Standardization Status===
* W3C_Editors_Draft
* W3C_Working_Draft
* W3C_Candidate_Recommendation
* W3C_Recommendation
* Deprecated ''For technologies that have been replaced or retracted, and are not recommended for use (but which are valuable to have for reference)''
* Non-standard ''For technologies that are not yet being standardized in any formal body, don't have 2 or more compatible implementations, and likely never will''
* Defacto-standard ''For technologies that are not yet standardized, but have 2 or more compatible implementations (modulo prefixes)''
* Experimental ''For technologies that are not yet being standardized, don't have 2 or more compatible implementations, but aim to one day be a standard''
* ''TODO: fill out this list with other standards bodies''

===Browser Support===
Which browsers support this technology.  'Stable' means that that browser's most recent main release includes support. 'Preview' means that a preview release of that browser (e.g. a "Beta", "Alpha", or "Developer Preview") includes support. Only one of these tags should be included for each browser (and always the highest one).
* Internet_Explorer_Stable
* Firefox_Stable
* Safari_Stable
* Opera_Stable
* Chrome_Stable
* Internet_Explorer_Preview
* Firefox_Preview
* Safari_Preview
* Opera_Preview
* Chrome_Preview
===Prefixes===
* Prefix_Everywhere ''Every stable browser this ships in includes the prefix''
* Prefix_Somewhere ''At least one stable browser ships this without a prefix''
* Prefix_Nowhere ''No stable browser ships this with a prefix''
