title: WPD:Flags/Content Biased Voice
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have a biased voice that represents a strong point of view. For example, articles that including marketing or spam included among legitimate content should include this flag. You should also mark the specific content that is in a biased voice using the associated Editorial block. If the <i>entire</i> page sound like a marketing page or spam, you should probably mark it as a <a href="/wiki/WPD:Flags/Deletion_Candidate" title="WPD:Flags/Deletion Candidate">candidate for deletion</a> instead. Pages that are overly focused on one browser vendor should get the <a href="/wiki/WPD:Flags/Content_Not_Neutral" title="WPD:Flags/Content Not Neutral">not vendor neutral</a> flag instead (although it's conceivable that an article would have both of these flags if the article is very vendor specific and also uses very biased language).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>Once the entirety of the article has a netural point of view that does not unfairly support any specific viewpoint or product this flag can be removed.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>Be sure to mark which content has biased voice problems using the associated editorial block: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Content_Biased_Voice" title="Template:Editorial/Content Biased Voice">Template:Editorial/Content_Biased_Voice</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the biased content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the biased pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
</p><p>If <i>most</i> of the content is biased, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
