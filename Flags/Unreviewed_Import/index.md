This flag is used to mark content that was automatically imported from another source (generally Microsoft Developer Network) but has not been manually reviewed to verify the content is accurate, complete, and correctly flagged.

==Manual of Style==
''Not applicable''

==Work Items==

There are many things to check for before removing this flag:

* For API_Object pages, that all applicable methods, properties, and events are listed.
* For other pages, that the correct "*_applies_to" properties are set to link them to their overview pages.
* That content is not incorrectly formatted or hidden due to markup problems.
* That all of the appropriate flags are set.
* That the content is not ''mis''-linked to other pages, generating incorrect information.
* ''Help us extend this list!''

You may remove this flag once you've reviewed those bullet points and applied the applicable flags and editorial notes for the pages.
