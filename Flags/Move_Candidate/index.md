This flag is used to mark pages that should be moved. Often this is because a file was imported in the wrong place or because someone created an article in the wrong place in the hierarchy.

==Manual of Style==
{{TODO | Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.}}

==Work Items==
If an article has this flag, someone should suggest the correct location in the Editorial block. Consult the [[WPD:Architecture]] doc. Once it's been moved to the right location this can be removed.

==Editorial Block==
If you check off this flag you should include a [[Template:Editorial/Move_Candidate]] template in the body that describes where the article should be moved to.
