title: WPD:Flags/Move Candidate
---
<p>This flag is used to mark pages that should be moved. Often this is because a file was imported in the wrong place or because someone created an article in the wrong place in the hierarchy.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>If an article has this flag, someone should suggest the correct location in the Editorial block. Consult the <a href="/wiki/WPD:Architecture" title="WPD:Architecture">WPD:Architecture</a> doc. Once it's been moved to the right location this can be removed.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>If you check off this flag you should include a <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Move_Candidate" title="Template:Editorial/Move Candidate">Template:Editorial/Move_Candidate</a> template in the body that describes where the article should be moved to.
