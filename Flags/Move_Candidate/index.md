title: Move Candidate
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Move Candidate'

---
This flag is used to mark pages that should be moved. Often this is because a file was imported in the wrong place or because someone created an article in the wrong place in the hierarchy.

## <span>Manual of Style</span>

**TODO**: Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.

## <span>Work Items</span>

If an article has this flag, someone should suggest the correct location in the Editorial block. Consult the [WPD:Architecture](/WPD:Architecture) doc. Once it's been moved to the right location this can be removed.

## <span>Editorial Block</span>

If you check off this flag you should include a [Template:Editorial/Move\_Candidate](/Template:Editorial/Move_Candidate) template in the body that describes where the article should be moved to.
