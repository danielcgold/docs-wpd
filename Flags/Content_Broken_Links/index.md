title: Content Broken Links
uri: 'WPD:Flags/Content Broken Links'

This flag should be checked for articles that have links that do not work. There is an optional Editorial block associated that only needs to be used to mark off-wiki broken links (as on-wiki broken links render in red).

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## Work Items

Once every link in the article is valid you can remove this flag.

## Editorial Block

If there are off-wiki links that are broken, use this editorial template: [Template:Editorial/Content\_Broken\_Links](/Template:Editorial/Content_Broken_Links).

The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
