title: WPD:Flags/Content Broken Links
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have links that do not work. There is an optional Editorial block associated that only needs to be used to mark off-wiki broken links (as on-wiki broken links render in red).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>Once every link in the article is valid you can remove this flag.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>If there are off-wiki links that are broken, use this editorial template: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Content_Broken_Links" title="Template:Editorial/Content Broken Links">Template:Editorial/Content_Broken_Links</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
