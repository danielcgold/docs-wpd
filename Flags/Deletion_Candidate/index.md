title: WPD:Flags/Deletion Candidate
---
<p>This flag is used to mark pages that should be deleted. Sometimes this is because the page is spam or not about topics applicable to the site. Note that pages that should be <i>merged</i> with others do <b>not</b> get this flag.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>If an article has this flag, the community should decide if it does indeed meet the criteria for deletion and then an administrator should delete it.
</p><p>If the page is not clearly spam and there's a primary author of the page (for example, it was created recently by someone) at least <i>some</i> effort should be made to involve that person in the deletion discussion before deleting. Failing that, at least getting a quick sanity check "SGTM" from someone on IRC is reasonable before deleting. If the discussion gets more involved, it should move to e-mail.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>If you check off this flag you should include a <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Deletion_Candidate" title="Template:Editorial/Deletion Candidate">Template:Editorial/Deletion_Candidate</a> template to specify details about why it's being considered for deletion.
