title: WPD:Flags/Split Candidate
---
<p>This flag is used to mark pages that have content that should be split into multiple articles. In practice this may because a single article has grown too large to suitably cover a single topic.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Develop which section of Manual of Style this is related to.
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>If an article has this flag, first think what other article should be created. Then create that article and start splitting up the content.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>If you check off this flag you should include a <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Split_Candidate" title="Template:Editorial/Split Candidate">Template:Editorial/Split_Candidate</a> template in the body.
