title: WPD:Flags/Content Grammar Spelling
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have grammar or spelling errors. You should also mark the specific content that has grammar or spelling problems using the associated Editorial block.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>Once the entirety of the article has correct grammar and spelling, this flag can be removed.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>Be sure to mark which content has problems using the associated editorial block: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Content_Grammar_Spelling" title="Template:Editorial/Content Grammar Spelling">Template:Editorial/Content_Grammar_Spelling</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the content with problems as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the problem pieces are in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
</p><p>If <i>most</i> of the content has problems, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
