title: WPD:Flags/Content Outdated
---
<p>This flag should be checked for articles that have some content that is outdated. You should also mark the specific content that is outdated using the associated Editorial block.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manual_of_Style">Manual of Style</span></h2>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Work_Items">Work Items</span></h2>
<p>In general the way to remove the flag is to research how or why the flagged content is out of date and correct it, citing your sources when possible.
</p>
<div style="border:1px solid hsl(45, 100%, 40%); padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:hsl(45, 88%, 94%); border-radius:5px">
<p><b>TODO</b>:  How best to cite your sources? 
</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editorial_Block">Editorial Block</span></h2>
<p>Be sure to mark which content is outdated using the associated editorial block: <a href="/wiki/Template:Editorial/Content_Outdated" title="Template:Editorial/Content Outdated">Template:Editorial/Content_Outdated</a>.
</p><p>The editorial block should be as close to the outdated content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the outdated is in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.
</p><p>If <i>most</i> of the content is outdated, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
