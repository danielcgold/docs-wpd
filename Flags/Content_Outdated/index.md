uri: 'WPD:Flags/Content Outdated'

---
This flag should be checked for articles that have some content that is outdated. You should also mark the specific content that is outdated using the associated Editorial block.

## Manual of Style

**TODO**: Figure out which piece of Manual of Style this relates to

## Work Items

In general the way to remove the flag is to research how or why the flagged content is out of date and correct it, citing your sources when possible.

**TODO**: How best to cite your sources?

## Editorial Block

Be sure to mark which content is outdated using the associated editorial block: [Template:Editorial/Content\_Outdated](/Template:Editorial/Content_Outdated).

The editorial block should be as close to the outdated content as possible. If that's not possible (for example because the outdated is in a rigidly-structured part of the page), then put it in the Editorial Block at the top of the page.

If *most* of the content is outdated, the editorial block should go in the Editorial Blocks section at the top of the page.
