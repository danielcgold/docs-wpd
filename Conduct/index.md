=Public conduct/displine guidelines=

We do not yet have a code of conduct for webplatform.org. Until we do, we expect to follow (roughly) the Wikipedia code of conduct — see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette

In general, the goal of webplatform.org is that the community shall be self-policing and shall create a code of interactivity that reflects the cooperative nature of the site. To that extent:

* Any user whom the community collectively trusts to be a productive member of the community and uphold the three pillars may be promoted to administrator. When someone wants to become an administrator, they need to make a request to the existing admins group, and they will approve it on a case by case basis. The process will be documented somewhere on the admin pages of the site.
* Administrators may block users, promote other users to administrators, or delete, rename, move, or lock pages.
* Administrators must use their privileges in a manner consistent with the Community Charter (or else they may lose those privileges).
* We expect that Administrators will post relevant administrative information on a portion of the site.
* The community will have a means to contact Administrators to inform them of issues that require attention, including out of date content, offensive content, edit wars, etc.

==General notes about webplatform conduct==

Throughout the webplatform site and related resources — including the Wiki, forums, chat, and other sections — we expect communication to be on topic, respectful and courteous at all times.

The topic of the site is client-side web development, which is a very broad topic, but it gives some idea of what we're aiming at. We don't want to discourage any meaningful technology conversation and writing, but we would like to keep the site focused on this area to keep it manageable and maintainable.

Therefore, if we start to see too much off-topic discussion, trivial/comedy banter, or other disruptive activity in any of our communication mechanisms, we may step in and politely ask the people involved to cut it out/take it to another, more suitable venue.

If it persists, we may be forced to start banning users.

Instant bans will be put into effect on community members who:

* Start spamming our communication mechanisms with blatantly unhelpful material, such as adverts, broken code, and nonsense material.
* Threaten or are abusive to other community members.
* Post messages that are of a rascist, sexist, homophobic, or other similarly hateful nature.
