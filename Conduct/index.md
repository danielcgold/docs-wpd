=Public conduct/displine guidelines=

Throughout the webplatform site and related resources — including the Wiki, forums, chat, and other sections — we expect communication to be on topic, respectful and courteous at all times.

The topic of the site is client-side web development, which is a very broad topic, but it gives some idea of what we're aiming at. We don't want to discourage any meaningful technology conversation and writing, but we would like to keep the site focused on this area to keep it manageable and maintainable.

Therefore, if we start to see too much off-topic discussion or trivial/comedy banter in any of our communication mechanisms, we may step in and politely ask the people involved to cut it out/take it to another, more suitable venue.

If it persists, we may be forced to start banning users.

Instant bans will be put into effect on community members who:

* Start spamming our communication mechanisms with blatantly unhelpful material, such as adverts, broken code, and nonsense material.
* Threaten or are abusive to other community members.
* Post messages that are of a rascist, sexist, homophobic, or other similarly hateful nature.
