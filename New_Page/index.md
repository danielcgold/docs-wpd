This page is the way that you should create new pages.

To create a new page:
# Figure out where the page should live. Consult the [[WPD:Architecture | architecture]] page for an overview of the URL structure of the site.
# Identify the most specific form below that fits the type of content you'd like to create. The forms are listed in decreasing order of specificity.
# In the associated input box, type the full name of the page you'd like to create (including slashes if you're creating a sub-page) and hit the "Create foo" button, where "foo" is the name of the form you want to use.

==CSS Property==
For pages that document a CSS property, like <code>font-size</code>. Generally, all pages that have a URL that begins with <code>/css/properties/</code> should live here.
{{#forminput:form=CSS_Property|default value=css/properties/foo|button text=Create CSS Property Page}}

==Basic==
For content pages (that is, pages in the default namespace) that do not have a more specific form to use.
{{#forminput:form=Basic|button text=Create Basic Page}}
