There are several special pages that Stewards should know about:
* [[Special:ArticleFeedback The Article Feedback dashboard]]
* [[Special:AdminLinks]], which functions like a dashboard, with helpful links. This is handy for create templates. 
* [[Special:Version The Mediawiki version page]], including all information about our current installation, such as extensions
* [[Meta:Deployment Mediawiki Deployment Instructions]], for installing extensions, adding software to the site, etc.
