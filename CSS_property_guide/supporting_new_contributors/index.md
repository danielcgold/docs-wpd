==How we support new contributors==

===Ambassadors===
When a new contributor volunteers, assign an ambassador who:
* provides a warm welcome
* offer to walk them through getting registered and picking a property.
* let the know about channels of communication
* point out some key pages or tips and tricks
* adds newcomer username to this page
* follow up with them in a couple of days to see if they were successful.

===Weekly content wrangling meetings===
# Set up a regular time, and establish a rhythm.
# Post how and where to ask questions -- i.e., the IRC #webplatform channel
# Set a goal at the beginning of the meeting
# Track progress on project page or here

===Help budding writers===

People think it's easy to just copy and paste. But actually, it's just as easy to think on your own. People just need to know how to proceed.

Ask new contributors if they want help breaking down how to edit their first page. Something like:

* Find the page that needs creation
* How to read a spec to pull out the necessary information
* Fill in the basics, like the values and types
* Researching reputable sites, such as MDN
* Look at other sources for inspiration, such as tutorials, blogs, github
* Then play with it yourself in code.webplatform.org
* Pick some examples from your experimentation that illustrate how to it work in common-use, real0life situations
* Then, describe how you can use it
* Don't fill in the compat info, that will be done automagically later
* Focus on the details, on the examples, and referencing the right specs
* If you see other great content elsewhere on the web, don't copy-and-paste it, add links at the bottom of your page
* Then, let the world know you have a draft up and ask for feedback, seeking out experts, tweeting in the community, etc.
