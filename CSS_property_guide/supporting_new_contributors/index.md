==How we support new contributors==


===Ambassadors===
When a new contributor volunteers, assign an ambassador who:
* provides a warm welcome
* offer to walk them through getting registered and picking a property.
* let the know about channels of communication
* point out some key pages or tips and tricks
* adds newcomer username to this page
* follow up with them in a couple of days to see if they were successful.
