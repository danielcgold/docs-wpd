<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Coordinators">Coordinators</span></h3>
<p>When a new contributor volunteers, assign a coordinator who:
</p>
<ul><li> provides a warm welcome</li>
<li> offer to walk them through getting registered and picking a property.</li>
<li> let the know about channels of communication</li>
<li> point out some key pages or tips and tricks</li>
<li> adds newcomer username to this page</li>
<li> follow up with them in a couple of days to see if they were successful.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Helping_contributors_with_CSS_properties_page">Helping contributors with CSS properties page</span></h3>
<ol><li> WebPlatform Wednesday we pick a bundle of CSS property articles for that week</li>
<li> To prevent people from being intimidated by a blank page, we create stubs for those articles, with the link to the specification where you will find the basic information to start from; I would hope we could automate this with a script (it would be nice to also insert the topic cluster)</li>
<li> We put the word out for contributors, on this list, on the blog, on Twitter, on the CSS public mailing list, among our companies, in the site notice, etc.; we direct them to this email list, or IRC or Twitter if they are not into email</li>
<li> When people show up to commit, we have designated "greeters" for each page (one of the core community folks who knows how to do things will each take 3-5 pages to be responsible for), who recruits, trains and encourages the contributor, removing roadblocks and facilitating quality contributions</li></ol>
<ul><li> If we get more contributors than we need, we pull a few more articles into the list</li>
<li> If we don't get enough contributors, we either ask the existing contributors to take on a little more work, or we make a new call, or we adjust our goals (date or amount)</li></ul>
<ol><li> Once a contributor has finished their task, they tell their greeter, who make sure the next stage happens (typically, review), and they take care of the "paperwork" in the Giant Scary Spreadsheet</li></ol>
<ul><li> We ask the contributor to tweet about their contribution, to give themselves props and to spread the word; we retweet these from @webplatform</li></ul>
<ol><li> The next week, we take stock on what actually happened, how much got done and what wasn't done, and we pick the next set of articles</li></ol>
<ul><li> We blog about the progress, and about the next set of work. (Rinse, repeat; apply praise liberally.)</li></ul>
<p>Split the work down into more discrete, manageable tasks:
</p>
<ul><li> basic facts, such as overview table, syntax, and values</li>
<li> explanatory text, such as the introduction (summary), usage, and notes</li>
<li> examples, with explanations</li>
<li> review, and flagging and unflagging</li>
<li> links to tutorials and other materials (either inside WPD or on the wider web)</li></ul>
<p>Each contributor might sign up for one or more tasks for one or more articles; you only want to fill in basic facts? Great, take 3 or 4 articles, that will probably go quick. You are good at a more creative, time-consuming skill like explanatory text? Ok, maybe you should only commit to 1 or 2 pages. You like making examples? Pick 2 or 3 articles. You want to do the complete page? Okay, pick 1 and go to town.
</p><p>Compatibility table information is not in this breakdown; we will soon have automated compatibility tables, so we should discourage people from trying to edit this manually for now.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Help_budding_writers">Help budding writers</span></h3>
<p>People think it's easy to just copy and paste. But actually, it's just as easy to think on your own. People just need to know how to proceed.
</p><p>Ask new contributors if they want help breaking down how to edit their first page. Something like:
</p>
<ul><li> Find the page that needs creation</li>
<li> How to read a spec to pull out the necessary information</li>
<li> Fill in the basics, like the values and types</li>
<li> Researching reputable sites, such as MDN</li>
<li> Look at other sources for inspiration, such as tutorials, blogs, github</li>
<li> Then play with it yourself in code.webplatform.org</li>
<li> Pick some examples from your experimentation that illustrate how to it work in common-use, real0life situations</li>
<li> Then, describe how you can use it</li>
<li> Don't fill in the compat info, that will be done automagically later</li>
<li> Focus on the details, on the examples, and referencing the right specs</li>
<li> If you see other great content elsewhere on the web, don't copy-and-paste it, add links at the bottom of your page</li>
<li> Then, let the world know you have a draft up and ask for feedback, seeking out experts, tweeting in the community, etc.</li></ul>
