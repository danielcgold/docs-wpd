'''Note:''' Support status for other UAs (mobile browsers, smaller browsers, authoring tools) may also be added and available by filtered use of tags; the ones listed above should be available by default.

'''Note:''' Support status table should be automatically constructed by presence of tags or external API, not by hand

* Quick-glance color-coded browser support icons?

== Normative documents ==
* Link to relevant draft/spec section
* Might be more than one version(e.g., HTML4 & HTML5)
* Or more than one draft (e.g., W3C & WHAT-WG)
* Or more than one name (e.g., JavaScript 1.8.5, EcmaScript 5th Edition)

==Standardization Status==
* Standardizing body or bodies (e.g. W3C, W3C and WHATWG, W3C and IETF, Khronos, etc.) (link)
** Specific Working Groups or Technical Committees working on that specification (link)
** Feedback link: email list, issue tracker, etc.
* Status Label (e.g. for W3C: Editor's Draft, First Public Working Draft, Working Draft, Last Call, Candidate Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation, Recommendation)
** Boolean stability value: '''stable''' or '''unstable''' (arbitrary, but useful)
** Stability icon or color-code?

==Code block==
<pre>
var foo = "This is some code.";
var bar = "It should have syntax-coloring and line numbers.";
var baz = "This code could actually be quite long.";
</pre>

==Admonitions==
Not a separate section. Admonitions can occur anywhere in explanatory text. They should be styled to be visually distinctive. A more severe category of "Warning" is not usually necessary in software docs.

'''Note:''' This is an admonition that calls out some information for particular attention.

'''Caution:''' This is admonition that warns about a potential pitfall, such as data loss, security risk, etc.

==Page Asides==
===External Resources===
'''Note:''' WPD tutorials and guides should point to relevant WPD reference page, which provides links to external resources; other pages should avoid pointing outside the site unless no reference page (or stub) exists for that feature (except for "Further Reading" to external articles).  This will minimize the number of articles which have to be updated when specs change versions, and promote consistent linking practices
* Further Reading: article of note on other sites which will not have analogs on WPD
* Links to spec in which feature is defined 
* Links to other sites with useful info, such as MDN, MSDN
* "what links here", list of articles that point to this page, available upon demand (e.g. not initially loaded)
