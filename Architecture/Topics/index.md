<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Topics">Topics</span></h1>
<p>Topics are categories that denote that a given article is about a given topic. They're similar to concepts like "Tags" in other contexts.
</p><p>Topics are distinct from <a href="/wiki/WPD:Flags" title="WPD:Flags">flags</a>; whereas flags denote temporary work-items to complete on an article, Topics denote permanent properties of <i>content</i> that will help people find it easily.
</p><p>Most articles have a form section for Topics that can be checked off. This form section is automatically generated based on which categories have the Topics category on them.
</p><p>You can see which topics there are either by viewing that part of any page editing form or this list: <a href="/wiki/Category:Topics" title="Category:Topics">Category:Topics</a>.
</p><p>Topics differ from "Topic Clusters" because Topics are designed to be wide-ranging "tags" throughout the site that end users may use to find content, whereas Topic Clusters are used very specifically to auto-generate portions of the See Also sections, and nothing else. See <a href="/wiki/WPD:Editors_Guide/step_6_author_or_upload_new_content#Topics_and_topic_clusters" title="WPD:Editors Guide/step 6 author or upload new content">Topics and topic clusters</a> for more information.

<ol><li> Create a Category:Foo page. Add <b>[[Category:Topics]]</b> to it to make it a sub-category of the Topics category.</li>
<li> Add the topic name (<i>exactly</i> the Category name, minus <code>Category:</code>) to <a href="/wiki/Property:Topics" title="Property:Topics">Property:Topics</a>. This property is how the Topic form section's checkboxes are automatically generated.</li></ol>
