Topics are categories that denote that a given article is about a given topic. They're similar to concepts like "Tags" in other contexts.

Topics are distinct from [[WPD:Flags|flags]]; whereas flags denote temporary work-items to complete on an article, Topics denote permanent properties of ''content'' that will help people find it easily.

Most articles have a form section for Topics that can be checked off. This form section is automatically generated based on which categories have the [[Category:Topics|Topics category]] on them.
