## <span>Summary</span>

We are using Bugzilla on this project for two types of bugs:

-   Site functionality bugs - errors, UI issues.
-   Multiple page content problems - when an issue is related to entire groups of pages (otherwise, when an issue is related to a specific page, use the page flags).

Use the following guidelines:

1.  **If it not in bugzilla, it doesn't exist.** If you are working on something that takes more than an hour or that you can't get to immediately, please log it as a bug. That includes marketing tasks.
2.  **First, check if there is an existing bug report on your issue.** If so, add a comment there instead. (Duplicate bug reports cost us time.)
3.  **All bugs should include**:
    -   reproduction steps,
    -   URLs,
    -   browser type and version,
    -   when you found the bug,
    -   and screenshots if a UI issue

4.  **Priority changes** should only be done when initially creating the bug, or by me or one of the following TF leads only:
    -   Content: Janet, Chris, Eliot, Doug
    -   Marketing: Alex, Christos, Ian
    -   Infrastructure: Doug, Alex
    -   Hackathon: Peter

5.  **Assign all bugs to someone specific**, and not Doug Null and not a group in general. If in doubt, assign to me: ssweeney@arborheights.net.
6.  **Assign to one of the TF leads when possible** and have them do any delegatation. During the war room, we need to be able to discuss each and every bug. If a bug is assigned to someone not in the war room, I need the TF leads to at least understand the latest with those bugs and be able to discuss the bug in the war room.
7.  **Our priority system**:
    -   Pri 1 - Must have, can't release without
    -   Pri 2 - Should have, release will suffer without it
    -   Pri 3 - Nice to have
    -   Pri 4 - Next release, out of scope for sure for this release
