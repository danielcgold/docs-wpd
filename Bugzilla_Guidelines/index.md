title: WPD:Bugzilla Guidelines

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Bugzilla_Guidelines">Bugzilla Guidelines</span></h1>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
<p>We are using Bugzilla on this project for two types of bugs:
</p>
<ul><li> Site functionality bugs - errors, UI issues.</li>
<li> Multiple page content problems - when an issue is related to entire groups of pages (otherwise, when an issue is related to a specific page, use the page flags).</li></ul>
<p>Use the following guidelines:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>If it not in bugzilla, it doesn't exist.</b>  If you are working on something that takes more than an hour or that you can't get to immediately, please log it as a bug.  That includes marketing tasks.</li>
<li> <b>First, check if there is an existing bug report on your issue.</b> If so, add a comment there instead. (Duplicate bug reports cost us time.) </li>
<li> <b>All bugs should include</b>: 
<ul><li> reproduction steps, </li>
<li> URLs, </li>
<li> browser type and version, </li>
<li> when you found the bug, </li>
<li> and screenshots if a UI issue</li></ul></li>
<li> <b>Priority changes</b> should only be done when initially creating the bug, or by me or one of the following TF leads only:
<ul><li> Content: Janet, Chris, Eliot, Doug</li>
<li> Marketing: Alex, Christos, Ian</li>
<li> Infrastructure: Doug, Alex</li>
<li> Hackathon: Peter</li></ul></li>
<li> <b>Assign all bugs to someone specific</b>, and not Doug Null and not a group in general.  If in doubt, assign to me: ssweeney@arborheights.net.<br /><br /></li>
<li> <b>Assign to one of the TF leads when possible</b> and have them do any delegatation.  During the war room, we need to be able to discuss each and every bug.  If a bug is assigned to someone not in the war room, I need the TF leads to at least understand the latest with those bugs and be able to discuss the bug in the war room.</li>
<li> <b>Our priority system</b>: 
<ul><li> Pri 1 - Must have, can't release without</li>
<li> Pri 2 - Should have, release will suffer without it</li>
<li> Pri 3 - Nice to have</li>
<li> Pri 4 - Next release, out of scope for sure for this release</li></ul></li></ol>
