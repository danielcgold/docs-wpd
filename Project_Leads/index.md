title: WPD:Project Leads
---
<p>Web Platform Docs has a number of <b>project leads</b>, both paid and volunteer. A project lead is someone who coordinates an activity, such as the creation and review of content for a particular topic, and reports back to the group as a whole; they may even create and review content themselves, though that's not necessary. An example of a project might be anything from a heading up all CSS properties, to just a particular CSS feature like animations; it might be translation of content into a specific language; or it might be unrelated to content, like SEO, site analytics, or issue tracking. It's best when the project lead is a <b>subject-matter expert</b>.
</p><p>It's important to note that the project lead is not an executive role, but a facilitation role. A collaborative project like WPD will have many people with different skills and approaches, and it is stronger for that; we operate on consensus. If an irresolvable issue arises between a contributor and a project lead, it can be escalated to the stewards by emailing W3C's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mailto:schepers@w3.org">Doug Schepers</a>.
</p><p>Currently, the process for becoming a project lead is deliberately unstructured and meritocratic; if you want to be a project lead, first demonstrate that you are capable of doing the task that you want to lead, then introduce yourself on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org">public-webplatform mailing list</a>, and let us know your interest. Sometimes, a project might be big enough to merit having more than one project lead, or there might be a general project lead coordinating with people focused on smaller tasks within that project.
</p><p>We manage all of our projects on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://project.webplatform.org">project.webplatform.org</a>.

<p>We currently have several project leads. If you are have questions about a topic, or are interested in contributing substantially to that topic, feel free to contact these leads on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://project.webplatform.org">project.webplatform.org</a>.
