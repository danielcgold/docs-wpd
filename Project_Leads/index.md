Web Platform Docs has a number of **project leads**, both paid and volunteer. A project lead is someone who coordinates an activity, such as the creation and review of content for a particular topic, and reports back to the group as a whole; they may even create and review content themselves, though that's not necessary. An example of a project might be anything from a heading up all CSS properties, to just a particular CSS feature like animations; it might be translation of content into a specific language; or it might be unrelated to content, like SEO, site analytics, or issue tracking. It's best when the project lead is a **subject-matter expert**.

It's important to note that the project lead is not an executive role, but a facilitation role. A collaborative project like WPD will have many people with different skills and approaches, and it is stronger for that; we operate on consensus. If an irresolvable issue arises between a contributor and a project lead, it can be escalated to the stewards by emailing W3C's [Doug Schepers](mailto:schepers@w3.org).

Currently, the process for becoming a project lead is deliberately unstructured and meritocratic; if you want to be a project lead, first demonstrate that you are capable of doing the task that you want to lead, then introduce yourself on the [public-webplatform mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org), and let us know your interest. Sometimes, a project might be big enough to merit having more than one project lead, or there might be a general project lead coordinating with people focused on smaller tasks within that project.

We manage all of our projects on [project.webplatform.org](http://project.webplatform.org).

We currently have several project leads. If you are have questions about a topic, or are interested in contributing substantially to that topic, feel free to contact these leads on [project.webplatform.org](http://project.webplatform.org).
