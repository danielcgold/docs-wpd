<ul><li> Account status in the Q&amp;A is bumpy.  You can login and get your IP address shown and be contributing under WikiSysops or you can login and everything just works.  You can also be in one state and randomly go to another.</li></ul>
<ul><li> The issue flags with pages need to be documented better so it is more clear what should be done to remove a flag.</li></ul>
<ul><li> UNCONFIRMED:  Possible cache issues.  See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://talk.webplatform.org/forums/index.php/2131/where-is-the-cache?show=2170#a2170">this post</a> for more details.</li></ul>
<ul><li> BugTracker being hosted on W3.  There seems to be some among the community that think the bugtracker shouldn't be hosted on another domain (or at least require another account.)</li></ul>
