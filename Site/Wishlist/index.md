<pre>We plan to have a system on Kuma by which users can indicate their areas of expertise 
and offer to be notified when reviews are requested in those areas. A separate set of 
reviewers would handle requests for editorial (copy-editing) reviews.

Whenever a user posts a change to an existing article, they have the option to mark either 
or both of those. New articles will default to having both options checked on.
