==Rich Snippets==
Google Webmaster Tools suggest marking up the site with [https://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170 Rich Snippets] from [http://schema.org/ Schema.org] to improve search engine findability, which could also improve our site semantics and even our API. We might be able to integrate some or all of these into our templates; we might even be able to improve upon the vocabularies and terms listed on Schema.org.

Here are some preexisting vocabularies that might be appropriate:
* [http://schema.org/docs/full.html The Type Hierarchy]
* [http://schema.org/TechArticle Tech Article]
* [http://schema.org/APIReference API Reference]
* [http://schema.org/Code Code]
* [http://schema.org/DataType Data Type]

'''''Note:''''' Currently, Schema.org recommends '''microdata''' syntax, but this may be supplanted by the increasingly popular and powerful '''RDFa Lite''' syntax.
