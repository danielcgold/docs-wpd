## Rich Snippets

Google Webmaster Tools suggest marking up the site with [Rich Snippets](https://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170) from [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) to improve search engine findability, which could also improve our site semantics and even our API. We might be able to integrate some or all of these into our templates; we might even be able to improve upon the vocabularies and terms listed on Schema.org.

Here are some preexisting vocabularies that might be appropriate:

-   [The Type Hierarchy](http://schema.org/docs/full.html)
-   [Tech Article](http://schema.org/TechArticle)
-   [API Reference](http://schema.org/APIReference)
-   [Code](http://schema.org/Code)
-   [Data Type](http://schema.org/DataType)

***Note:*** Currently, Schema.org recommends **microdata** syntax, but this may be supplanted by the increasingly popular and powerful **RDFa Lite** syntax.
