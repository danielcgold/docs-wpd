If you find an issue related to the content of the site (e.g. an article is incorrect or missing), you have a few choices:

## Content bugs

-   **Fix it yourself**. [Learn how](/WPD:Getting_Started) to contribute. If you find a fairly trivial fix, such as a typo, bad grammar, broken example, or obvious incorrect piece of data, **please fix it yourself**. You can probably fix it quicker than you could file a bug about it!
-   **Add a comment**. To add a comment, hover your mouse over the relevant section heading and click **Add Comment**. This is useful for more serious content issues that you aren't sure how to solve. Leaving a comment on a page helps us more easily track down exactly what needs to be fixed.
-   **Add a flag**. Flags visually mark pages that are suffering from common issues, such as being incomplete or incorrect. See [Using Flags](/WPD:Flags) for details.
-   **File a bug**. Do this **only** if it is not something that is covered by the three options above. See below for how to file a bug, if appropriate. Again, please don't file bugs concerning problems that you can fix yourself.

## Site bugs

If you find an issue related to the functionality of the site, file a bug (see below). The main groups of bugs we are seeing are as follows:

-   **Site functionality bugs** (for example, browser errors or UI issues).
-   **Issues related to entire groups of pages** not behaving or displaying correctly.

## Browse existing bugs
