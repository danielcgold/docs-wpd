title: WPD:Filing Bugs
---
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="WebPlatform.org_bugs">WebPlatform.org bugs</span></h1>
<p>If you find an issue related to the content of the site (e.g. an article is incorrect or missing), you have a few choices:
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Content_bugs">Content bugs</span></h2>
<ul><li> <b>Fix it yourself</b>. <a href="/wiki/WPD:Getting_Started" title="WPD:Getting Started">Learn how</a> to contribute. If you find a fairly trivial fix, such as a typo, bad grammar, broken example, or obvious incorrect piece of data, <b>please fix it yourself</b>. You can probably fix it quicker than you could file a bug about it!</li>
<li> <b>Add a comment</b>. To add a comment, hover your mouse over the relevant section heading and click <b>Add Comment</b>. This is useful for more serious content issues that you aren't sure how to solve. Leaving a comment on a page helps us more easily track down exactly what needs to be fixed.</li>
<li> <b>Add a flag</b>. Flags visually mark pages that are suffering from common issues, such as being incomplete or incorrect. See <a href="/wiki/WPD:Flags" title="WPD:Flags">Using Flags</a> for details.</li>
<li> <b>File a bug</b>. Do this <b>only</b> if it is not something that is covered by the three options above. See below for how to file a bug, if appropriate. Again, please don't file bugs concerning problems that you can fix yourself.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Site_bugs">Site bugs</span></h2>
<p>If you find an issue related to the functionality of the site, file a bug (see below). The main groups of bugs we are seeing are as follows:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Site functionality bugs</b> (for example, browser errors or UI issues).</li>
<li> <b>Issues related to entire groups of pages</b> not behaving or displaying correctly.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Browse_existing_bugs">Browse existing bugs</span></h2>
<p>See the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://project.webplatform.org">Project Management page</a> for lists of issues by category.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_file_bugs">How to file bugs</span></h2>
