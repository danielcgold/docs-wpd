=Filing bugs=

If you find a functional bug (not content related) please file a bug at [https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=webplatform.org Web Platform Docs Bugs]. This bug tracker is used for two types of bugs:

* Site functionality bugs  - browser errors, UI issues.
* Problems with multiple page content - When an issue is related to entire groups of pages (otherwise, when an issue is related to a specific page, use the [[WPD: Fl|page flags]]).

For more guidance about filing these different types of bugs, see the [[WPD:Bugzilla_Guidelines|Bugzilla Guidelines]].
