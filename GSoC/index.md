==Ideas==

===Browser Compatibility Table API===
'''Brief explanation:''' Build an API for use on our site and by the general public for accessing information on browser support for various web programming features, integrating data from multiple different sources, such as CanIUse, Quirksmode, and W3C test suites. See the [[WPD:Compatibility_Info|Compatibility Info article]] for more information.

'''Expected Results:''' All articles on WebPlatform.org, and users on other sites and resources, will have access to fine-grained, test-driven, automated browser support tables for all features of the Web Platform.

'''Knowledge Prerequisite:''' HTML, CSS, JS, PHP (and MediaWiki extension knowledge) helpful, testing methodology. '''Skill level:''' medium to high.

'''Mentor:''' Doug "shepazu" Schepers <schepers@w3.org>

===Crowdsourcing Browser Testing===
'''Brief explanation:''' Build a workflow and UI for a specification test management system, including a way to select a spec, define or choose a set of testable assertions from that spec, input a test without needing to add metadata and other automatable information, submit the test for review, and collaborate in the review using a peer-reviewed upvote system. See the [[WPD:Crowdsourcing_Testing|Crowdsourcing Testing article]] for more information.

'''Expected Results:''' Efforts such as [http://testthewebforward.org/ Test the Web Forward] would have access to a systematic, prioritized, low-barrier, and efficient , spec-test crowdsourcing application to manage the creation, review, and community around tests.

'''Knowledge Prerequisite:''' HTML, CSS, JS, back-end language of choice, testing methodology. '''Skill level:''' medium to high.
