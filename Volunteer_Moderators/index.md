=Volunteer moderators for IRC and Q&A=

This page provides information for those who have volunteered to be official webplatform moderators for our IRC and/or Q&A. First of all, thanks for agreeing to do this. Second, read all the notes below to make your lives as easy as possible.

==What is expected of you==

You are expected to act as moderators on the webplatform IRC and/or Q&A, so basically to hang around on those properties, answer questions, point people to the information they need, and deal with troublemakers/spammers.

You aren't expected to do this all the time, of course, and the webplatform staff will hang out on IRC/Q&A as much as possible. The aim here is just to take a bit of pressure of the webplatform.org guys, as moderating these venues 24/7 is a really time consuming task!

==Codes of conduct==

Please read the [[WPD:Conduct|WPD conduct guidelines]] to get a feel for what is acceptable and what isn't, in terms of topics of questions and chat, and dealing with troublemakers.

==FAQ==

One role is going to be answering questions. A lot of these questions will be repeated over and over again. We are aiming to create an IRC bot that will pick up on common phrases and auto-generate replies, plus the IRC room topic provides links to URLs for [WPD:FAQ|FAQ], [[https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/ bug tracker]], etc. Feel free to point people towards these reaources or quite out of them, as you see fit.

The Q&A is soon to be improved, with categorization, etc., things will be more manageable there soon as well.
