We need to schedule some time with a legal person who can help us structure our branding guidelines.

More specifically we want to add to B-reel's logo style guide ([[File:Web-Platform-Style-Guide-05.03.2012.pdf]]) with some additional rules on the usage of the logo, to ensure that it doesn't get (too) abused.

Here are the things for the legal person to write up in a clearer way.

==For Users==
* Don’t modify the logo in any other way than what is prescribed in the guide, other than resizing.
* Don’t make the logo the primary element on your page.
* Keep some distance between the logo and other logos and icons on your page. (might be good to define some pixels).
* Don’t use the logo on a page that contains or displays adult content, promotes gambling, promotes violence, contains hate speech, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under twenty-one years of age, violates other applicable laws or regulations or is otherwise objectionable.
* Make sure that clicking the logo always links to Web Platform Docs.
* If your product is compatible with Web Platform Docs, make reference this by using the text "for", "for use with", or "compatible with". Example: "Search Extension for Web Platform Docs"
* You can not use the stewards logos without permission.

==For Stewards==
* Your usage of Web Platform Docs should not imply that your company is the only sponsor of this initiative
* (Other things??)

We will also need a designer to include some examples of things to do and things to avoid.
