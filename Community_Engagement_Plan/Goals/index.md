<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Web_Platform_Docs_Community_Engagement_Goals.2C_Metrics.2C_and_Execution">Web Platform Docs Community Engagement Goals, Metrics, and Execution</span></h1>
<p>This document describes some high-level community engagement goals for the Web Platform Docs site, metrics to measure progress, and tactics and mechanisms for promoting those goals. These goals are not currently quantified. We can establish growth targets after setting a baseline during the initial roll-out of the site. Tactics are actions that support the goals; mechanisms are features of the site that support the goals.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goal:_Attract_readers">Goal: Attract readers</span></h2>
<p>This is primarily a marketing goal, addressed by marketing tactics, and measured by the usual traffic metrics. However one traffic metric is relevant to engagement.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metrics">Metrics</span></h3>
<ul><li> New visitors per week (need to figure out how this is defined)</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goal:_Attract_contributors">Goal: Attract contributors</span></h2>
<p>Visitors signal their interest in contributing to the site by registering as members.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metrics_2">Metrics</span></h3>
<ul><li> New registrations per week</li>
<li> New registrations/new visitors = conversion rate</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanisms">Mechanisms</span></h3>
<ul><li> Call-to-action to join visible on every page</li>
<li> Completing registration takes the user back to the page on which they clicked “Join”, so they can finish what they wanted to do.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goal:_Encourage_contributions">Goal: Encourage contributions</span></h2>
<p>We want people to not merely sign up and lurk, but to actively and constructively contribute. Contributions include creating new documents and editing existing documents. Most people will contribute immediately upon registering; that is, registration is a hurdle in front of contributing. We want them to continue contributing after their first time.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Metrics_3">Metrics</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#160;% new members that contribute to the wiki within 24 hours of joining</li>
<li>&#160;% new members that contribute again within 1 week of joining</li>
<li>&#160;% members that contribute over 30 days (“active” members)</li>
<li> Contributions per active member per month</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tactics">Tactics</span></h3>
<ul><li> Send welcome email upon registering, with pointers to Getting Started Guide, list of things to help with, forums, IRC, user profile, etc.</li>
<li> Send personalized thanks email for first contribution: should be appropriate to the type of contribution, include title and URL of page modified, and include an expression by a real person of how the contribution will help the project.</li>
<li> Send congratulations email after N contributions (need to calibrate appropriate values for N)</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mechanisms_2">Mechanisms</span></h3>
<ul><li> Auto-generated welcome email</li>
<li> Feed of changes by new members, with button to generate thank-you email based on a template; record of who emailed and when.</li>
<li> Auto-generated congratulations email</li>
<li> Tracking of number of contributions per member (so we can set milestones at 5, 20, 100, whatever)</li>
<li> Badges (recognition) for: first N members; contribution milestones; helping people on forums; being administrator, etc.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goal:_Encourage_engagement">Goal: Encourage engagement</span></h2>
<p>If members interact only with the site, and not with each other, they do not create relationships or build community. We want members to interact with each other through forums and IRC.
