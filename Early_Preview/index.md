Before we make a larger announcement, we want to invite a bunch of folks to an early preview of the site to provide commentary and help get make improvements in advance of the alpha announcement.

To avoid spoiling the surprise, we'll limit the number of folks who can participate in the early preview. We'll make it so that the user accounts have to created by hand, and each person who wants an account will have to contact the Administrator (most likely Doug) and tell him how they found out about it before getting an account.

The following is a list of folks to invite to the early preview:
